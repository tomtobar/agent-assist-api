    "body": "Overview In the quick, interactive tutorial attached to this article, you will practice adding a calendar to the call-to-action section of the Inquiry form. In this Article Overview of the steps involved in adding a calendar to the inquiry Try it yourself Overview of the steps involved in adding a calendar to the inquiry Please note that these steps are only a high-level overview of what's required. Check out the tutorial at the bottom of the article to walk through the process step-by-step. 1. Add the new option to the call to action (inquiry events) field. To begin, you will need to edit the field that holds the call-to-action options in your Inquiry form. In this practice scenario, we've added an option to Schedule a Tour. Note the name of the call to action field by locating it within the backend of the inquiry form. (These fields are typically called something like \"Inquiry Events.\") Search for the field in your fields page (Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields) Edit the field to add the name of the new option for the calendar sign-up.* *Once added, the new option will immediately appear in your inquiry form, so it's important to complete the whole process, including edits to the form itself, in one sitting. 2. Add the calendar to the inquiry form. Next, you'll edit the inquiry form to include the calendar that you'd like to appear when the parent selects the new option you added to the call to action section. Make a draft and edit of the inquiry form. Enter the backend (advanced form editor) of the form. Under the call to action field, select to add a new field below the current one. Add a section header to introduce the calendar and make the header dependent on the new option in the call to action section of the form. Add a comment field to provide additional information about the event and make this field dependent on the new option in the call to action section of the form. Add an appointment field to officially attach the calendar to the form and make this field dependent on the new option in the call to action section of the form. Finally, save these adjustments! (Remember, a more in-depth, step-by-step walkthrough of the process can be found in the interactive tutorial at the bottom of this article.) 3. Publish your form Next, publish the form to make the changes live. Within the form edit page (Settings &gt; Forms &gt; Inquiry Forms), open the Select menu in the Actions column on the draft and select the Publish (Make Active) option. It's also a good idea to save a note on the form to record what adjustment was made to the form. Step 4: Check your work Finally, you want to be sure to preview your form to confirm that the CTA option and its associated sections are working as expected. Within the form edit page (Settings &gt; Forms &gt; Inquiry Forms), open the Select menu in the Actions column and select Preview to open a preview of the Inquiry form. Try it yourself 78 STEPS 1. In this tutorial, we'll add an option to schedule a tour to the call to action section on the Inquiry form. Click Next to proceed. 2. The first thing you need to do is to update the Inquiry events field with the new tour option. We'll locate the name of the field in the form and then edit it on the fields page. 3.

    "body": "Overview Understanding how field visibility and Social Security Number (SSN) privacy work is essential for managing your site effectively. This article explains the \u201cHide from Form\u201d setting, which hides field information from the PDF view of a form when enabled, and the automatic SSN feature, which masks all but the last four digits of Social Security Numbers wherever they are displayed. In this Article Hide from Form Social Security Number Privacy Hide from Form When Hide From Form is selected for a field, it conceals the value of that field from admins when they view it on a form. For instance, in the image below, both the Gender field and the Applicant's Birth Date field have Hide From Form enabled. Consequently, when an admin views the form, they will not see the data stored in those fields. When \"Hide From Form\" is selected: Parents will still be able to see the data within the field on their end. Regardless of an admin's permission level, whenever they view forms on the record, download the PDF version of the form, or check out the form in the review module, they will encounter 'Hidden From View' instead of the actual data for any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled. This only applies to viewing the field on a form. Any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled will continue to display its data within searches, on the contact record (if the field is visible in the Contact Widget or within tabs like Personal, Admissions, or Enrollment ), in emails, and any other location where the field is displayed. The information is only hidden from admin when the view the field on a form. Good to know: Hide Form Form is reversible. You can de-select ' Hide From Form' in the field settings at any time and, as soon as you do so, the data will start to display again. Social Security Number Privacy It is possible to collect Social Security Numbers within Finalsite Enrollment; however, it is crucial to take precautions to ensure that this sensitive information is maintained securely. Please refer to the following recommendations for safeguarding the data, as well as details regarding its storage and display within Finalsite Enrollment if you are collecting it. Using Caution with Social Security Data Only assign the social security number field to the \"Secure\" field grouping . Check on your team's permissions within Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Admin Portal Accounts so that only team members with the \"Secure\" permission checked off can view this information. We do not recommend marking the field as searchable within the fields page. Where and how is the SSN field data displayed within your site? Contact Record : Social Security numbers are masked in contact records, with only the last four digits visible. Searches: In searches, only X\u2019s are displayed, and the full number cannot be revealed. Exporting search results: In CSV or Excel exports, only X\u2019s are shown and the number can not be revealed. PDFs of Forms: On PDFs, only the last four digits are visible and there is no way to reveal the number. How to Un-hide Social Security Numbers and who has the ability to un-hide SSNs? Unhiding the SSN If you are displaying the SSN field within student records, you'll have the option to unhide it so that it can be edited. Select the Edit Fields option. Select Show/Edit under the SSN field. Select Save Edits to save the change. Who can make changes to the SSN field? If you have your SSN field set up within the Secure field grouping , as we highly recommend as a best practice, only Admins with the Secure permission will be able to view and edit the field. Anyone who does not have \"Secure\" permissions set will not see the Secure grouping on the record and any of the fields within it. Log of who has unhidden a Social Security Number Our team keeps an internal log of who has accessed or edited the SSN field on the student record. If you need Audit information about who has viewed or edited an SSN field, please reach out to our Support team.

    "body": "Overview During the payment process, parents can choose to use Link (powered by Stripe ) to securely save their payment information. This will make their future payments easier by auto-filling their payment details. Once signed up, parents can also use Link to autofill their Credit Card info on any other website that supports Link. In this Article Good to know How does this work? Troubleshooting and Support Library of Resources Good to know Link is created by Stripe (the tool that powers our Payment processing.) Link is automatically enabled for all Stripe Payments schools. (It doesn't cost anything and doesn't need to be set up on your end. It's already there as an option for parents.) Using Link does not affect or interfere with Autopay setup. Link is secure. Here's an excerpt from Stripe's website regarding security: Since Link is powered by Stripe, a global payments provider, we are certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1 . This is the highest level of certification available in the payments industry. How does this work? The option to use the Link appears for parents wherever they can make a payment and is available only for saving Credit Card information (not for Electronic Check payments.) It appears as a button that says Autofill link to the right of the Credit Card details box. First-time users are prompted to enter their email, phone, and credit card details to complete the setup. Once they do that, they are all set. If a user is already registered with Link, such as through another site, Link will recognize this and prompt them to enter a one-time passcode. Once entered, their name, credit card information, and other details will be automatically filled in (they just have to re-enter their CVC code each time they make a payment using Link.) Troubleshooting and Support Since Link is built by Stripe, the Stripe support team is best equipped to assist with any issues related to storing or managing credit card information using this tool.

    "body": "Overview A merge token is a placeholder that pulls in information from a contact, like their name or address, and adds it to emails, letters, labels, forms, parent portal, and contact records. This makes it easier to personalize your communications, as the merge field automatically fills in the right details for each contact. This article is a helpful reference guide that covers some of the most common merge tokens you\u2019ll use, so you can easily create personalized messages and documents.

    "body": "Overview How do duplicate appointments happen? When you share a Public Calendar link , families can easily click the link, select a date, and input their information. Since it's a public link without login requirements, there's no way to stop someone from accidentally signing up multiple times. To help you manage duplicate bookings, we've set up layers of alerts to notify you, allowing you to check in with the family and remove any duplicate bookings. Good to remember Public calendar links should only be used for events that you are sharing with families who have not yet applied. Why's that? Well, for one, every event booked through a public calendar link creates a brand new inquiry record for a student in your system. If the kiddo is already an applicant, there's room for issues if the inquiry gets imported and mixes up the student's status in the system. Another reason is that, for students who have already applied to your school, the most straightforward way to share events is directly through their checklist. In this Article Duplicate Bookings in the Checklist Duplicate Bookings in a Calendar Search Duplicate Bookings in the Forms Inbox Duplicate Bookings in the Checklist If a parent books a duplicate appointment for the event, both appointments will be displayed on their checklist. (They'll display on your end in the Admin-facing checklist as well.) If you've allowed parents to cancel/reschedule appointments in the parent-facing checklist, they'll have the option to cancel/reschedule any of the appointments. In other words, if a parent has signed up for an event three times, they'll have the cancel/re-schedule option for all three bookings. Example of a duplicate booking on the parent-facing checklist: Example of a duplicate booking on the admin-facing checklist: Duplicate Bookings in a Calendar Search When creating a search to display the roster for your event , for any appointment that's booked more than once, you'll see multiple dates displayed for the student. Under the date column in the search, every date/time stamp that the family has booked for the student will be displayed. To manage the event sign-up, you'll need to go to the student's checklist. If you right-click on the student's name in the search, you can open their record in a new tab. From there, you can manage the event from their checklist. If you need to learn how to add an event to the checklist, you can learn that in this article: Linking Calendars to Checklist Items . Duplicate Bookings in the Forms Inbox When importing forms into your site , you'll be asked to review and confirm (or deny) any potential duplicates that the site suspects are present. As part of this process, if the family submitting the form has signed up for an event more than once, we'll alert you. If duplicate bookings are detected, you'll see a page within the import form pop-up that alerts you to the fact that we found multiple bookings. You don't have to take action on that page. (You can import the form without doing anything about the duplicate booking.) Or, if needed, you have the option to cancel one or more of the appointments right from that window by clicking Cancel. See it in Action What happens if you click cancel? If you click Cancel, you'll be asked to confirm whether or not you really intend to cancel the appointment. If you click yes , that specific event booking will be removed from the calendar and student checklist. If you click no , the event will remain booked, and you'll see it listed as it was before, with the option to Cancel it.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Explore allows families to manage their school search and application process from one location. Schools can enable Finalsite Explore (with the assistance of our team), offering families a more streamlined experience when it comes to searching for and applying to schools. Finalsite Explore is a free feature. You just need to connect with our team to begin the setup. The Student Information Form is an introductory form that parents complete when first creating an account in Finalsite Explore. It asks for basic student and family information that's used when the family submits an Inquiry through Explore. The provided information is also pre-populated into the application when a family applies to your school through Explore. In this Article Where do families encounter the Student Information form? How is the information used? What information is collected in the form? What if a family needs to add to or edit the provided information? Where do families encounter the Student Information form? When a parent creates an account for the first time in Finalsite Explore, they will be brought to the Student Information form. Note that we have two options for parents accessing Finalsite Explore: The regular login link invites families to start their journey by creating an account. With the regular login, the parent creates an account and is then brought to the Student Information form before they will explore schools. The browsing without an account option allows families to jump right in and start exploring options without an account. When using the browsing without an account option, parents can explore schools first. If they choose the Apply Now option, they will be directed to create an account. After creating the account, they will need to fill out the Student Information form before proceeding to complete the Application. How is the information used? The information in the Student Information form is used when a family selects More Information in Finalsite Explore. On the parent end, when they click the More Information link they are directed to the website added to your Finalsite Explore Content page (Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Finalsite Explore Content.) On the backend, your school is sent an Inquiry letting your know that the parent asked for more information. Whatever information they provided in the Student Information form is provided in the Inquiry that comes through to your site. In addition to the info coming through as an Inquiry if a parent selects, More Information, it's also passed on to your application. If the parent submits an application through Finalsite Explore, the information they provided in the Student Information form will pre-populate in the application so that they don't have to fill in the info a second time. What information is collected in the form? The Student Information Form asks families for basic information about their student and family. Here's a breakdown of what's asked for on each page: (the red asterisk denotes that the item is required) Page 1: Student Information * Full name: first, middle, last (middle name is optional) Preferred name Gender: When setting up your instance of Finalsite Explore, you'll determine which Gender options to include . You can also choose to either set this question as optional, required, or hide it from the form altogether. ( Our team must set this up for you.) * Date of Birth * Current Grade * Interested in Grade * For the Fall of * Current School Race: When setting up your instance of Finalsite Explore, you'll determine which Ethnicity options to include . You can also choose to either set this question as optional, required, or hide it from the form altogether. ( Our team must set this up for you.) Page 2: Household and Parent Information * Household * Address 1 (plus optional second line for the Address) * Country * City * State * Zip Parent Title * Full Name: first, middle, last (middle name is optional) Preferred Name * Primary phone number + Type Secondary Phone number + Type * Email * Employer * Job Title * Relationship to Student Add another Parent in this household?: If you select Yes , another set of Parent information fields appears. Page 3 Add a secondary household?: If you select Yes , additional fields for adding a second household address and parent information will appear. Note about customization The Student Information form can not be customized. You do, however, have the following options: Gender: You can choose from the following gender options to include: Female, Male, Non-Binary, Self-Identify, Prefer Not To Answer. You can list all or part of these options in the Finalsite Explore Student Information form. This is an internal setting. Your group can request updates to the gender options on your Finalsite Explore Information form at any point by contacting support .

    "body": "Overview There are two ways to share access to Finalsite Explore with your families. Our regular login link invites families to start their journey by creating an account. Our browsing without an account option allows families to jump right in and start exploring options without an account. We also offer the option for you to create a custom subdomain for your Finalsite Explore group to share with your families. It's important to note that custom subdomains are distinct from standard links. In this Article Finalsite Explore Regular Login Link Browsing without an Account Custom Subdomain Access to Explore Regular Login Link Browsing without an Account Finalsite Explore For groups who are not using a custom subdomain for their group, you'll share one of the following links to Finalsite Explore: the regular login link or the link that allows browsing without an account. Regular Login Link Sharing the regular login link requires visitors to start by creating an account. Regular Login Link to Finalsite Enrollment: https://portal.fsenrollment.com/ Visitor journey Visitor creates an account. The visitor is then taken to a page with a dropdown menu listing different school groups. Once the visitor selects a group, they are brought to the Student Information form where they are asked to fill in basic information. After completing the form, they are brought to the Explore Schools page where they can select any of the schools in the group to learn more about them. Browsing without an Account This link allows users to access Finalsite Explore without creating an account first. Browsing without an Account: portal.fsenrollment.com/explore_schools Visitor journey The visitor is taken directly to the page with a dropdown menu listing different school groups. Once the visitor selects a group, they are brought to the Explore Schools page where they can select any of the schools in the group to learn more about them. If they select Apply Now on any of the groups, they are brought to the account creation page where they need to start by creating an account. Once creating an account, they are asked to select a group again. After selecting a group, the visitor is brought to the Student Information form where they are asked to fill in basic information. It's important to note that users browsing without creating an account first will not see the More Information link. (That link brings them to the website of your choice and, on the backside, sends an inquiry to your school letting you know that they requested more information). If a user selects to apply to a school, they are then required to complete the Student Information form. Custom Subdomain Access to Explore Groups that have set up a unique subdomain will have a separate URL to share with families. If your school has set up a custom subdomain be sure to share your specific link with prospective families. Regular Login Link This link invites users to start by creating an account, after which they are brought directly to your school group list. Regular Login Link to Finalsite Enrollment: {CUSTOM SUBDOMAIN}.fsenroll.com Visitor journey Visitor creates an account. After creating an account, they are brought to the Student Information form where they are asked to fill in basic information. After completing the form, they are brought to the Explore Schools page where they can select any of the schools in the group to learn more about them. Note: With custom subdomain links, visitors won\u2019t choose between different school groups. Instead, they are taken directly to the list of schools within your specific group. Browsing without an Account This link allows users to start directly on your school group page. They don't have to create an account or select a group when they are first visiting the site. Browsing without an Account: {CUSTOM SUBDOMAIN}.fsenroll.com/explore_schools Visitor journey The visitor is brought directly to the Explore Schools page where they can select any of the schools in the group to learn more about them. If they select Apply Now on any of the groups, they are brought to the account creation page where they need to start by creating an account. After creating an account, the visitor is brought to the Student Information form where they are asked to fill in basic information. After completing the form, they are brought to the Explore Schools page where they will see a pop-up asking them to confirm an application to the school they selected in step 2. Note: With custom subdomain links, visitors won\u2019t choose between different school groups. Instead, they are taken directly to the list of schools within your specific group.

    "body": "Overview A custom page for Finalsite Explore allows you to guide prospective families directly to your group's list of schools when they visit the Explore portal. In this Article How does it work? How can I set this up? Branding Options for your Custom Finalsite Explore Group Page How does it work? Creating a custom page for your Finalsite Explore group means that you will have a unique link to send or share with families. When accessing Finalsite Explore through your custom link, families will land on your school's group page where they will only see the list of schools in your group.* *Depending on which link you share ( Regular Link or the Public Explore Link) , visitors will either create an account and then be brought to your group page or they will land right on the group page without having to log in. Read more about each experience below. Visitor Login Experience Regular Link {CUSTOM SUBDOMAIN}.fsenroll.com Upon logging in for the first time with the regular link, visitors complete the Student Information form, providing basic information about their student and family. After that, they are brought right to the Explore Schools page for your group. They will only see the schools in your group listed in the menu. Public Explore Link (browsing without an account) {CUSTOM SUBDOMAIN}.fsenroll.com/explore_schools If you provide visitors with the Public Explore link for your custom subdomain, they will arrive directly on the Explore Schools page for your group. They are not required to log in and will only see the schools your group listed in the menu. If they select to apply to a school, they are asked to create an account and complete the Student Information form. Choosing a domain name for the page This appears as part of the web address. Here's what to keep in mind about choosing a name: The maximum number of characters allowed is 63. It can include numbers. It can not include special symbols (like underscores or dashes.) It can not include special characters like accents (for example: \u00e9) The name must be unique (not in use by any other group.) We'll let you know if we see this is the case. Also, you can request to change the name of your domain at any time. Just make sure to update the link wherever you are using it! How can I set this up? If you are interested in setting up a custom page for your school group, please connect with our support team and let us know what you'd like your link name to be! Branding Options for your Custom Finalsite Explore Group Page Within your custom group page, you can set a custom background and logo for your group. In addition to that, the name of your group will automatically appear within the Explore page. Logo and background images are added by our team. Please reach out and provide us with the images that you'd like us to implement for your group. Logo and Background Best Practices Here are a few best practices to consider when formatting the logo and background images that you provide to us for your group's page. Logo Size: For header logos, aim for an image width between 300 and 600 pixels. Format: PNG: Consider formatting your logo with with a transparent background. PNG formats support transparent backgrounds. Remember, though that transparency might not look ideal on all background colors. A 24-bit PNG is the best choice for quality. JPG: JPG formats will also work in our logo uploader, however, this format doesn't support transparent backgrounds so your logo will have a white or colored background surrounding the logo area. File Size: Try to keep your logo file size between 11 KB and 500 KB. This will help maintain good image quality without slowing down loading times. Background Size: For best quality, use a background image size of 2400 pixels wide by 1800 pixels high. While other sizes are supported, this one is optimized to look great across various screen sizes. Format: JPG or JPEG formats are the recommended formats for your background image.

We'll be opening this up once we have completed our testing and feature improvement. If you are interested in this feature or have questions, please connect with your client success manager. Financial Edge NXT (FE NXT) is an online accounting tool made by Blackbaud. In Finalsite Enrollment, we can export your payout information in a format that works with FE NXT . In addition, we can connect your Finalsite Enrollment system with Blackbaud to send information directly into FE NXT. This article outlines the setup process for building an API connection between your site and FE NXT. Here are the basics of what we need... This is what we'll need in a nutshell to get your project started. For a more in-depth guide on what we'll be asking you to provide, follow the questions in the blue box below. The column headers/field names in FE NXT that you'd like us to push information into. We also need to know what information you'd like us to push into those FE NXT fields. And, finally, if you have any specific formatting needs, we will need you to note that. For example, do you push credits as negative amounts or positive amounts? we need to know those details to ensure that your data is formatted like you need. Here are the questions we need you to answer to get the project rolling... What is the accounting platform you will be importing this data into? When are you currently inputting/importing this data? For example: I input/import charges/credits at the beginning of the year and then apply payments to the total as payments are received I only input/import when payments are received What level of information are you planning to import? For example: I will only import totals for accounts. I do not plan to import by parent/student I will import at the student level I will import at the parent level I will import at both the parent and student level We find that some schools import with the billing category breakdown, while others import all charges and payments to a set account/ledger code. What is your desired process? For example: I would like to import with the billing category breakdown I would like to export totals (payments/charges) to a set account/ledger code. (Please provide the account/ledger code.) We can schedule exports to run daily, weekly, or monthly. Would you like us to schedule this export at regular intervals? Finally, and most importantly, we need an example of the file that you are importing into your other system, which you can attach below, so we can determine what will best work for you. Interested? Please start by connecting with our team to let us know you'd like to connect your site with FE NXT. FAQs Can I add any additional fields to the export? We have limited flexibility with including additional fields or customizing the data. Please confirm with our team if there is something specific you are looking for.

Admin Account Types: System Admin and Admin Permissions: Data Quick Note Fields are the containers that store specific data about students, parents, or other contacts in the system. This article dives right into the steps of finding a field. If that's not what you are looking for, this might help: If you are new to understanding fields you might want to check out our Fields Overview article. If you are looking for a guide on how to create fields, our Creating and Editing Fields article is for you! Options for Finding Fields We have two options to recommend for exploring your fields. Click the links below to be brought right to that section! On the Fields Page : When you navigate to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields, you will see a list of all of the fields on your site. Use the filters to make searching a breeze! In a Form : Another option is to go right into the backend view of one of your forms (like your application!) This is helpful because it just might contain all the info you need in one easy place. On the Fields Page Open your fields page: Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields Expand the Filter Options to type in a search, or apply a Grouping or Field Type. Pro Tips If you are completing a Data Dictionary , you can either use the Display Name or the Canonical Name in the Finalsite Enrollment Field Name column of the dictionary. If you building a search with a specific field, you will choose the Contact Record Data (Everything Else) option and then type in the Display name of the field as seen here on the fields page. Searching by field Display Name within a Search. In a Form Usually, the application includes the fields that you are looking for so we are going to look at the application in the steps below. However, if you need to look at the field names on any of your other forms, you'll follow pretty much the same steps. The only real difference will be that you will choose a different form group in the Forms dropdown. Open your Application forms page: Settings &gt; Forms &gt; Application Forms On the Active application form, select Show Form from the select dropdown in the Actions column. Select Show to open any of the pages. You will find the canonical (internal field name) in the Field column. Additional Notes If you are completing a Data Dictionary , you can use the canonical (internal) name of the field as it is listed here in the Finalsite Enrollment Field Name column of the dictionary. The canonical name is everything listed after \"CHILD.\" For example, in CHILD.is_international, is_international is the canonical name of the field. You can search by the canonical name in the text search option of the fields page.

    "body": "Overview Each year, as you prepare for enrollment and update your site, it's important to review and manage any fields related to tuition and fees. This article will guide you through the process and highlight key options and checks to consider. Reminder: The difference between term-based and non-term-based fields Term-based fields clear out with rollover and non-term-based fields do not clear out (they keep the same data year over year unless it's manually cleared out). Some examples of non-term-based fields include custom tuition assistance and scholarship fields, academic or athletic fees, transportation fees, etc. In this Article Updating fields that drive tuition Check your contract fee rules Updating field values on students Updating fields that drive tuition Some of your fields are directly connected to contract fees and the data within them impacts the tuition and fee charges that appear on the contract. It is therefore, really important to check on these fields and update what you need to every year as you prep for re-enrollment. Here's how to do that. Check your contract fee rules Under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Contract Fees, you will find both your contract fees and the rules attached to them. Good to know You don't have access to directly edit contract fee rules. Please contact our support team if you need to adjust a contract fee rule. Expand the contract fee to see which fee rules (if any) are attached to it. If the fee has a rule or rules attached to it, it will be listed under the rule column. Here, you are checking for a couple of things: The fields itself : A general check of the field is a good practice to familiarize yourself with which fields are driving tuition and fees. The canonical name of the field is what's listed behind the \"m.\" and before the \"==\". For example, in the fee rule m.finacial_aid == true, the canonical name of the field is \"financial_aid\" For a deeper dive, copy the canonical name and search for it on the Fields page (Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields). The values listed for Single Select or Multi-Select fields (where applicable): For rules that depend on Single Select or Multi-Select fields, it's a good practice to double-check that the values listed reflect what you need. For example, if you are looking at a rule that lists preschool program selection options, are the options up to date? Remember, connect with our support team if you need to make adjustments to contract fee rules. Updating field values on students Every year, it's important to add/update values to any field that you need to either trigger a fee for a student or add an amount in them (ex. scholarship amounts). You can update fields directly on the student record, in bulk with a search, or with an update import. Direct Updates on Student Records: Navigate to individual student records and update relevant fields such as scholarship amounts. Read the details of updating fields on the student record, here, in our Contact Record: Enrollment Tab article. Bulk Updates via Search : Pull up a search with your returning enrollment students or filter the Students in Enrollment list page (Enrollment menu &gt; Students in Enrollment) and use the Edit menu to update the field in bulk. Read more on how to make a bulk update like this in our Bulk Update article. Import Updates: For larger-scale updates, it's most practical to update the fields via an import. Follow the directions in this article to learn the step-by-step of updating current students in bulk via an import: Import Templates: Updating Existing Contacts Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Term-Based Fields &amp; Enrollment Refresh Non-Term-Based &amp; Required Enrollment Fields Enrollment Refresh Process",

A couple of reminders before we jump in Only System Admins and Admins (with any permissions) can access the Forms pages. Forms are located within the Settings &gt; Forms menu. The following steps must be accomplished within the Advanced Form Editor. Once you make a draft of a form, select Go to Advanced Form Editor from the menu in the Actions column. Adding text to your forms (sections, subsections, and headers) You can add sections, subsections, and comments within your form. While you need to accomplish this in the Advanced Editor, we recommend that you use the Basic Editor to make adjustments to the style of the text as it will make it much easier to edit the color, size, add links, etc. Step 1: Within the Advanced Editor, select to add a field from the Actions column, or at the bottom of the page. Step 2: In the Type dropdown, select one of the text addition options: Section Header, Subsection Header, or Comment. Step 3: In the Prompt or Comment Section, add the title of your header or the comment text you are adding. If you select to add a Section or Subsection, you will see a Prompt box where you can add the header text. If you select Comment, you will see a Comment box that is a little bit bigger so that you can add paragraph text within it. You can expand that box to make it bigger if you need. Optional: You can select \"Show/hide this field based on other fields?\" if you'd like to add a dependency. It means that whether the question appears on the form depends on the answer given in another field. A common use case of this is the grade field. For example, when adding a question (field) to ask which preschool program families are interested in, you would select this option and then isolate the preschool grades so that the option only shows to the relevant families. We have a whole article on dependencies and filter options that we recommend you check out. Saving your Work Remember to save your changes before exiting the Advanced Editor! Errors If you see a red banner at the top of the page it means that there is an error on the page. The error will be described within the message. If you are unable to resolve the error on your end, please connect with support who will be able to guide you. Making Simple Text Edits After you save your changes, go to the Basic Editor to preview your addition and make simple text edits to the prompt and any other text. Good to know: Edits made in the Basic Editor save automatically. You won't find a save button in that editor. Publishing Your changes will only be live when you publish the form.

A couple of reminders before we jump in Only System Admins and Admins (with any permissions) can access the Forms pages. Forms are located within the Settings &gt; Forms menu. The following steps must be accomplished within the Advanced Form Editor. Once you make a draft of a form, select Go to Advanced Form Editor from the menu in the Actions column. Adding questions/prompts to your forms Questions on forms are tied to fields within your site. That's how the system knows where to store the information and it makes it easy for you to find it within searches and on the contact record. These steps will teach you how to add fields to your forms so that you can collect data in the form of questions or prompts. Step 1: Within the Advanced Editor, select to add a field from the Actions column, or at the bottom of the page. Step 2: In the Type dropdown, check the Field option is selected. Step 3: In the Internal Field Name section, select the canonical name of the field. You will need to know the canonical name of the field that you are adding. That can be found on the fields page. Step 4: In the Prompt section, enter the question or prompt. This is what families will see when they fill out the form. Step 5: In the Map To dropdown, select the entity that this data should be mapped to in the system. For example, if the data should be appearing on the student's record, you need to map this information to the CHILD option. In most cases, you should select CHILD. The following steps are optional... The Explanation section is optional. If you add text here, it will appear above the question within the form. Below the explanation section, you have the following options: Required?: This option will make the question required within the form. This means that parents will be required to answer the question before proceeding to the subsequent pages of the form. Read-Only?: This option pulls the field into the form but prevents families from editing it. You would only ever select this option if you are certain that you've already collected the information from the family and would like to display it for them. This option can be a bit finicky and tricky to adjust so, if you are interested in this type of option where you simply display data already collected, we recommend that you connect with our support team and we can help you add the information using liquid coding in a comment box instead. Hidden?: This advanced option hides the field. In other words, it makes it invisible on the parent end. In some cases, you may need to display text or questions based on information that you've already collected. You can do this by adding dependencies to your form fields but, if the field is not already on the current form, you'll need to pull in the field where the data is stored. You can manage that with this option by adding the field but then hiding it from view. That will allow you to make other questions dependent on the data within the hidden field without displaying it on the form. Show/Hide this field based on other fields?: This is where you can add a dependency. It means that whether the question appears on the form depends on the answer given in another field. A common use case of this is the grade field. For example, when adding a question (field) to ask which preschool program families are interested in, you would select this option and then isolate the preschool grades so that the option only shows to the relevant families. We have a whole article on dependencies and filter options that we recommend you check out. More Options Default Value: This allows you to set a default value for the question. It only works with certain types of fields like yes/no or single select. When utilized, the question will have an answer that is defaulted but the parents will be able to make their own selection.

Whose data does GA4 track? How to add your GA4 code to your site Library of Resources What is GA4 and what do tracking codes do? GA4 is the latest version of Google Analytics. A GA4 tracking code is a small piece of code that you add to a site to help you track and understand how visitors use the site. Integrating your code with Finalsite Enrollment allows you to gain more robust data on your family's journey. Additionally, for clients who also use a Composer site with Finalsite (CMS), the same code can be utilized to provide a comprehensive tracking experience across the entire family journey. Tracking Consent We highly recommend adding a cookie consent manager, like Termly , when adding GA4 tracking to your site. Consent with a software like Termly is usually achieved via an automatic pop-up that appears on a webpage, informing users of how their personal information will or will not be saved and used on that site. Users can click through a consent confirmation to indicate that they want to continue using the site. Read more about setting up a consent tool in this article: Adding a Cookie Consent Banner (Termly) Whose data does GA4 track? GA4 data specifically tracks parent activity.

    "body": "Overview This article serves as an introduction to how families will encounter billing within Finalsite Enrollment. Its purpose is to provide you with a foundational understanding of billing and family dynamics within your site. In this Article Parent Accounts Parent Account View Parent Financial Split Parent Shared Access Parent Accounts The most important thing to know about the parent Billing experience is that every parent has their own, unique account. Why is that important? It's important because it means that Finalsite Enrollment operates differently from systems employing a single-family account model. This distinction influences how families engage with the platform and how their accounts are structured. Shared access and financial split both play a role in the parent's billing experience. We'll dig into those a bit further down, but for now, getting started, it's important to know that families are not interacting with a single \"family-account\". Parent Account View Here's a quick peek at what a parent's billing account looks like on their end. Now, depending on your school's setup, there may be one or two things that look different, but, for the most part, this is what they will see. Use Impersonate to see what your setup is like Unfortunately, we can't show every single variable of Billing account setup so we encourage you to use the impersonate feature to take a look at what the billing management tab looks like for your parents. The more familiar you are with what they see, the better you will be at supporting them! Parent Billing Experience Check out this video to see how parents experience Billing management in the Parent Portal. (It's based on the parents' experience and is available to parents in their Help Center. ) Parent Financial Split Let's take a moment to talk about what a Financial Split is and how it affects your parents. We have a deep dive into this in the Billing: Setting the Financial Split article. If you are getting familiar with this, we highly recommend you save that article and make a note to read it. What is it? The financial split percentage determines how much each parent or guardian pays for contract tuition and fees and can be customized for each student. By default, all parents/guardians have a 0% split. If not set before contract signing, the person paying the deposit is assigned a 100% split. The split can be updated anytime. Updating the split will adjust the parent ledgers so that future contract charges reflect their assigned percentages. Here's an illustrated look at how Financial Split affects the parent ledger. Parent Shared Access Shared access allows a parent or billing account holder to grant access to another individual for making one-time payments on an account. We deep dive into shared access in our Billing: Shared Access article. That's another good article to bookmark and read later. To understand Shared Access and how it affects the parent payment experience, let's take a look at two different examples: A parent who is making a payment on their own account. A parent who is making a payment for another parent's account (shared access) A parent making a payment on their own account. In this quick learn video, you'll see the steps a parent takes to make a payment on their own account. A parent making a payment for another account. Need to know It's important to note that different scenarios with parent setup and history can lead to different experiences when making payments. Let's cover the most common scenarios to help you prepare for those situations and educate parents. Scenario 1 This is the most straightforward and most common scenario. Parent/Guardian A is assigned a 100% Financial Split. Parent/Guardian B has no financial responsibility but is assigned as a Shared Access Contact to Parent A. When Parent B logs in, they see Parent A's ledger and can make payments towards it. Here's what that looks like from Parent B's perspective. In this scenario, Parent B logs in and sees Parent A's ledger on the Billing Management tab. They only need to click \"Make a Payment\" to add a payment to Parent A's ledger. Scenario 2 Parent/Guardian A is assigned a 100% Financial Split. Parent/Guardian B has no financial responsibility but is assigned as a Shared Access Contact to Parent A BUT Parent B has also had a billing account established in the past. In this scenario, the parent will see a dropdown that says Select Account since they have access to their own ledger and the other parent's ledger. Important Parents need to check that they paying toward the correct ledger. A good rule of thumb: If the parents see the Select Account dropdown, they need to check that they are viewing the correct ledger before they make a payment. In the example below, you'll see how the parent can check the Select Account dropdown to make sure that they are on the correct ledger. You should make parents aware of both scenarios to help ensure that they understand how to correctly make a payment on a shared ledger. Thank you for being a part of Finalsite Enrollment Billing!

    "body": "Overview Within the billing tab on a parent/guardian record, you can access several additional tabs that allow you to track and manage an individual's Billing within Finalsite Enrollment. The Balances tab displays what's currently owed or credited in all billing categories, the students associated with each category, and the remaining balances. In this Article Accessing the Balances Tab Understanding the Balance Tab How To Correct Balance Issues Incorrect Category Alignment Moving Credit Balances to a New Term Accessing the Balances Tab From the Summary Tab of the Parent Record When you first land on a parent ledger, you are on their Summary tab. Select the Billing tab to open the Billing subtabs. Select Balances. From the Student Record From the Student's record, you can select the Billing tab to see a list of the parents who have billing accounts connected to the student. Select Billing. Select the parent name. Select Balances. Understanding the Balance Tab Within the Balances tab, you have three main headings: Category, Student, and Balance. Category Before expanding, you'll see the category group name. When you expand the group, you'll see the current individual categories that are associated with the student. Only the categories and groups associated with the account are displayed. Quick Questions Where are billing categories managed? You can manage Billing Categories and Groups under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories. What's the purpose of \"(Main)\" as part of the group titles in the example? In this example, the category group titles end in \"(Main)\". The purpose of this is to differentiate the \"Group\" from the \"Category\". This is an optional trick to prevent you from accidentally assigning transactions to the group rather than the specific category it belongs to. Groups and Categories are managed on the Billing Categories page. Student This column shows the student names and terms, with each student and term listed separately. In the image below, you can see that the account includes two students. Each student has fees in two groups: 'Tuition &amp; Aid (Main)' and 'Fees Group (Main)'. Balance The Balances column displays the balance for each category group, organized by student and term. When you expand the category groups, you'll see the balance for each specific category and the amount owed within it. How To Correct Balance Issues The Balance tab is an excellent resource for identifying ledger issues that may affect reporting. Below are a few common scenarios where adjustments are needed, what they look like on the Balance tab, and how to correct them on the ledger. Incorrect Category Alignment In some cases, a family's ledger may show a balanced ledger total, yet the Balances tab indicates imbalances, with some categories displaying negative amounts while others show positive amounts. This situation commonly arises due to discrepancies in Billing Categories, which can be rectified by updating the ledger with a zero-dollar adjustment to reallocate items into their appropriate categories. A ledger showing a zero balance. But, it's actually imbalanced, which can be seen on the balances tab. Notice that even though the total is $0, there's a credit balance in the Tuition &amp; Fees Category group. This non-aid credit balance gives us a clue about the issue. Although this discrepancy doesn't directly impact the family's finances, it can affect your reporting accuracy, prompting the need for adjustments. Good to know The Balances tab may not always display a total of $0, and this shouldn't necessarily be expected. However, if your ledger is balanced at $0 while the Balances tab shows disparities, it warrants attention as a potential issue. Just because you see a credit balance (red text color with a negative sign) on the balances page, it doesn't necessarily need to be corrected. Financial Aid and Scholarships should show up as a credit balance. It's when you notice a credit balance in a category that's not financial aid, that you should consider an adjustment to correct the issue. Now, let's walk through the steps of correcting this example imbalance to illustrate how to correct this issue. The Zero Dollar Transaction To correct the imbalanced categories, we're going to create a \"Zero Dollar Transaction.\" This means there won't be any change to what's owed on the ledger while allowing us to move items into the correct billing categories (thus balancing the ledger.) Here's a snapshot of what you need to do in these cases: (Pro Tip) Open 2 tabs: one tab on the Ledger view and another tab on the Balance view. This will make the process easier. Select to Add a Payment to the Ledger For the Description , enter \"Accounting Adjustment\" For the Distribution , select Manual Splits Do not add a Payment Method For the Received Date , you can enter the current date. Create a split for each category on the Balances tab. For each item, select the corresponding student and term that you see in the Balances tab. To know whether the Amounts should be negative or positive, follow what you see on the balances tab. For example, if you see on the Balances tab that Tuition is a credit balance of (-$10040.0), enter it as a negative on the Payment you are creating (-$10040.0.) Or, if you see that the Registration fee has a debit balance (300.0...note there is no negative sign), you will enter it as a positive on the Payment you are creating just as it is on the balances tab ($300.) Post the payment At Once , on the current date. The total amount at the very bottom of the Payment window should be $0.0. Preview to check your correction and post it to the ledger. Check your work on the balances tab, which should now reflect $0.0 in all categories as well as in the total amount section. If it's not, you can delete the adjustment on the ledger and try again or contact support who can provide more guidance on the steps you should take. Practice an example of correcting this in the interactive tutorial below. 46 STEPS 1. Pro Tip! Before you begin, start by opening two tabs. One tab on the Ledger view and another tab on the Balance view. This will make the process easier. Now, let's dive in! 2. Within the parent's Ledger tab, click Add Payment. 3. For the Description , type Accounting Adjustment Because descriptions are displayed on the parent end, this is a good way to clarify the activity to parents. 4. For the Distribution , select Manual splits 5. You do not need to select a Payment Method. This will make it easier to find when looking through or filtering transactions. 6. Click into the Received Date box to open the Date Picker. 7. Select the current date. In this example, select June 5th, 2024. 8. Now, we are on the Balances tab (which we've opened in a second tab to make things easier). Click to expand the Tuition &amp; Fees category group. 9. Take note of the categories and amounts within the group. Note whether or not the amount is negative or positive. In this example, let's start with Tuition. Note that it is a credit balance and note the amount. 10. Back on the Ledger tab, Select the Category box to open the dropdown. 11. For this example,select Tuition 12. Click Select contact to open the dropdown and choose the correct contact and term. 13. For this example, select Glory Bateman (2022-2023) 14. In the amount box, enter the same amount for the tuition category that we saw on the Balances tab, -10,040.00 . Don't forget to include the negative sign. We want it to exactly match the balances page. 15. Now we are ready to add our next category. Click Add Split 16. Now, we are going back to the Balances tab to check the next category, Tuition &amp; Fees. Note the amount in that category. 17. Back on the Ledger tab, Select the Category box to open the dropdown. 18. Select Tuition &amp; Fees 19. Click Select contact to open the dropdown and choose the correct contact and term. 20. Select Glory Bateman (2022-2023) 21. In the amount box, enter the same amount for the tuition and fees category that we saw on the Balances tab, 9240.00 . Note that, this time, there is no negative sign in front of the amount. 22. Again, we are adding another category. We'll do this for every category on the Balances tab. Click Add Split 23. Click to expand the Incidental Fees category group. 24. Pay attention to the Sports Activity Fee. Note the amount in that category. 25. Back on the Ledger tab, Select the Category box to open the dropdown. 26. Select Sports Activity Fee 27. Click Select contact to open the dropdown and choose the correct contact and term. 28. Select Glory Bateman (2022-2023) 29. In the amount box, enter the same amount for the Sports Activity Fee category that we saw on the Balances tab, 500.00 . 30. Now we are back on the Balances tab to check the final category in this example. Click to expand the Registration Fee category group. 31. Pay attention to the Registration Fee. Note the amount in that category. 32. Back on the ledger, Select Add Split to enter the details for the final split on this example. 33. Select the Category box to open the dropdown. 34. Select Registration Fee 35. Click Select contact to open the dropdown and choose the correct contact and term. 36. Select Glory Bateman (2022-2023) 37. In the amount box, enter the same amount for the Sports Activity Fee category that we saw on the Balances tab, 300.00. 38. Check the Total Amount section. When done correctly, the total amount should be zero. 39. For the Posting Option s, select At once 40. For the date, you will again choose today's date. For this example select Wednesday, June 5th, 2024 41. Click Preview to check the adjustment before confirming. 42. Click to expand the adjustment. 43. Once you've check the work, click Confirm to post the adjustment to the ledger. 44. Check the ledger to confirm that you still see a zero balance. 45. Go to the Balances tab and check the adjustment there. Note that we now see zero balances here in each category which lets us know that we were successful. 46. Great Work!

If you'd prefer to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library . Moving Credit Balances to a New Term On a parent's ledger, if any categories from a prior term have a credit in them, you should move the balance to the correct year once the current year ends. This is important because if you leave it in the past term, then, when new charges get added, the credit will not automatically apply to the new balances since it's tied to the previous term. Reminder: It's important to note that we are specifically referring to credit balances here. Here's what that would look like on the Balances tab. Notice how the account has a credit balance in 2023-2024 and a charge or debit balance currently owed in 2024-2025. You'll want to correct that to ensure that the credit balance from 2023-24 gets applied to the balances owed in the current term, 2024-25. We're going to use the Zero-Dollar Transaction again to move the credit balance, only this time, we'll use a negative and positive payment for the same amount to move the credit to the current term's balance. Here's a snapshot of what you need to do to move a credit balance to a new term (Pro Tip) Open 2 tabs: one tab on the Ledger view and another tab on the Balance view. This will make the process easier. Select to Add a Payment to the Ledger For the Description , enter \"Accounting Adjustment\" For the Distribution , select Manual Splits Do not add a Payment Method For the Received Date , you can enter the current date. Select the category that that credit balance is in. If you have a credit balance in more than one category, you will need to adjust each one individually. Check your balances tab to ensure that you are selecting the correct category. Select the correct contact and term. This is important. Be sure that you are checking that you have selected the term that holds the credit balance. Enter the amount just as it appears on the balances tab. You are correcting a credit balance so that amount will be negative on the balances tab. Enter it as a negative here as well. Select Add Split to continue. This time, select the same category. Select the contact and current term (the term you are moving the balance to.) Important: This time, enter the amount as a positive number. The total amount at the very bottom of the Payment window should be $0.0. Post the payment At Once , on the current date. Preview to check your correction and post it to the ledger. Check your work on the balances tab, which should now reflect $0.0 in the previous term and have a reduced or credit balance in the current term. If it's not correct, you can delete the adjustment on the ledger and try again or contact support who can provide more guidance on the steps you should take. Practice an example of moving a credit balance to the current term in the interactive tutorial below 30 STEPS 1. Pro Tip! Before you begin, start by opening two tabs.

    "body": "Overview We've designed our Lottery feature with the unique requirements of charter schools in mind. However, its intuitive design makes it beneficial for any institution utilizing it. Whether you're a charter school or not, you'll find it seamlessly integrates into your processes, enhancing efficiency and effectiveness. In this article, we'll cover the basics of lottery, giving you a high-level overview of how to utilize it and offering some answers to many of the questions we frequently see. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: System Admins and Admin Permissions: Any In this Article Lottery at a Glance Real World Scenario Tiers Siblings and Twins Frequently Asked Questions Library of Resources Lottery at a Glance The lottery operates through tiers, which are saved searches. These tiers help randomly choose students for either acceptance or placement on the Waitlist . The selection is based on the number of available slots in each grade. Here's how it works: First, create some saved searches to gather the groups of students you want to include in the lottery. Then, provide some basic setup details when initiating the lottery. And just like that! The lottery will randomly select the designated number of students for acceptance, while the remaining students will be put on the Waitlist. Real World Scenario Mystery Academy has 13 available seats for 2nd grade in 2025. They build two saved searches for their tiers: Tier 1 - Faculty Students Search Criteria: 2025 Applicant and Application Complete students who have the \"is_faculty_student\" field marked as \"yes\". 10 Results There are 3, 2nd Graders in this tier. Tier 2 - General Admissions (non-faculty) Search Criteria: 2025 Applicant and Application Complete Students who do not have the \"is_faculty_student\" field marked as \"yes\". 200 results There are 20, 2nd graders in this tier. The school then runs its lottery for 2025, with 2nd-grade students pulling in both tiers (saved searches). The lottery randomly selects 2nd graders from the 1st tier. There are only three and the school has thirteen seats, so, all three 2nd graders in the 1st tier search are moved to into the Accepted status. The lottery then moves to Tier 2. There are twenty 2nd graders in Tier 2 and now, there are 10 seats left for 2nd grade. The lottery randomly chooses ten of the twenty 2nd graders in Tier 2 and moves them to Accepted. The remaining ten 2nd graders are moved to Waitlisted. About Statuses: Accepted and Waitlisted Neither of these statuses is visible to parents. Here's what the parents will see for both: If the parent hasn't completed all of their checklist items: Parents will see the \"Applying for X Grade in [Term]\" message and still have access to their checklist. If the parent has completed all of their required checklist items: The parent will see the \"Application Complete\" message and still have access to their checklist. Tiers When setting up tiers for your lottery, you might find it helpful to ask yourself the following questions: Does any group of students get to run through the lottery first? Do we have sibling preference? Do we have only an enrolled sibling preference? Do we have only a sibling preference for admissions? Do we give a Faculty preference? Do we give preference based on religion or geographic area? Do we have any preferences based on our school programs or groups? Those questions will help you to identify how to structure the tiers for your lottery. Work smarter, not harder In addition to that, it's helpful to remember that you can recycle those saved searches (tiers) every year! Just be sure to go into the saved search every year before you run the lottery and update the term (and make any adjustments you need to the search) and then save it again so that you can use it in the lottery. Siblings and Twins We frequently receive inquiries regarding managing siblings and twins within the lottery system. When organizing your lottery, you'll encounter various strategies for handling siblings and twins. Within the lottery setup, you can set it up to automatically accept all siblings, to automatically accept siblings in the same grade, to automatically accept siblings in higher grades, or, with the \"no\" option, you can disable auto acceptance of siblings. What happens when you set your lottery to automatically accept siblings? All Siblings: When you run the lottery, if an accepted student has a sibling in any other grade, they will automatically be accepted. Siblings in the same grade: When you run the lottery, if an accepted student has a sibling in the same grade, they will automatically be accepted. Siblings in higher grades: When you run the lottery, if an accepted student has a sibling in any grade higher than the grade you are running the lottery for, they will automatically be accepted. With any of these options, once the lottery is run, you'll see a section called \"Auto Accepted For Other Grades\" within the View page. (That's the admin-facing page that shows you the results.) This section will display the list of any siblings in other grades that were automatically accepted when the lottery was run. A note on auto-accepted siblings When siblings are automatically accepted as part of the lottery, the system automatically updates their status to \"Accepted.\" Keep this in mind when planning your lotteries for other grades. In other words, if you want to accept 30 - 12th graders and the system automatically accepts one of them (through the auto-accept siblings feature), you'll need to account for that when you run the lottery for your 12th graders and only select to accept 29 of them when setting up your lottery. Waitlisting same-grade siblings together If you select All Siblings or Siblings in the same grade , you'll have the additional option of automatically waitlisting same-grade siblings together: Accepting twins but not siblings in the same grade We understand that some schools would like to admit twins together while excluding other siblings in the same grade. To facilitate this, we suggest considering the following options: Option 1 Create a custom field specifically for students who are twins. Update that field for all of your students who are twins. Set up a tiered (saved search) that pulls in your twins. Use that specific search as one of the tiers in your lottery. Option 2: Disable the option to Accept siblings in the same grade . Reduce the number of accepted students in the lottery to account for the addition of twins. Run your lottery. Check the results and, for the accepted students that have a twin, manually update their twin to an Accepted status. Frequently Asked Questions Can you run the lottery for our school? Nope, we\u2019re happy to help you with questions and setup but we can not run a lottery on your behalf. After a lottery is completed, does the student\u2019s status automatically change to the new status? Unless you are running a test lottery, the student\u2019s status will be automatically changed to \"Accepted\" or \" Waitlisted \" after the lottery is run. As a reminder, those statuses are not visible to parents. Are there unlimited tiers for the lottery process? Yes and no. Technically, you'll run into some issues if you try to add more than 30 tiers but it's rather unlikely that you'd need more than that amount to begin with so, have no fear when selecting your tiers. When running a lottery, are students assigned a waitlist position based on the tier of the lottery they were in? Yes, students in higher tiers appear above students who are Waitlisted in lower tiers. For example: tier 2 students would be assigned earlier positions on the waitlist than those in tier 3. Will students who withdraw and then reapply be included in the lottery? If the student is marked with the role of \u201cFormer Student\u201d, as long as they reapplied for the term you run the lottery for, they should appear in the lottery. However, be sure to remove the \u201cFormer Student\u201d role so that parent can complete their checklist. Are you able to show the lottery results as a number instead of a student name in the presentation results? Yes, Within the Lottery Settings page, you have the option to hide student names (and replace them with a unique Lottery ID for each student) and/or hide student birthdates when presenting your lottery. What is the waitlist used for if you aren\u2019t using Lottery? For non-lottery schools, it's just a status group. Nothing happens automatically unless the school sets up an Automated Communication Plan. it's just a way to organize students. the Waitlist still shows in the new student funnel counts but they do not enter enrollment.

    "body": "Overview The Explore Schools page in Finalsite Explore provides details about each school in the group. It's essential to make this page engaging so that you can nurture families towards applying. You can design this page under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Content &gt; Finalsite Explore Page . As a best practice, you should: Keep this page up to date. Include important deadlines and details that prospective families should know about. Add links for families to register for highlighted events. Design your page to stand out. Read on to learn some tips and tricks for making this page beautiful. In this Article Where can you update this page? Banners Images Text Edits Layout Example 1 Layout Example 2 Where can you update this page? To update the design of the main area displayed when a parent chooses to explore your school, navigate to the Parent Portal Content page (located under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Content &gt; Finalsite Explore Page). Selecting Explore Content will open the template window which allows you to design your Explore page. Banners Let's begin with banners. Incorporating a captivating banner at the top of the template is a warm invitation to capture attention. Here's how to add your school banner to the Explore Template: Within the template editor, select the image icon. You can then choose whether you want to upload an image file from your computer, upload an image from a link, or select one of the images that you already have stored in Finalsite Enrollment. Upload your image. Click on the image to see the image edit options. You can use these options to resize your image, add links, alternative text, and more! In the example GIF below, I've adjusted the width to 1440px and left the height to \"auto\" adjust. Always save your changes by clicking Save in the template. Here are our general recommendations for the best practices when it comes to Banner formatting: 1440px wide Max. 250px high If you use a full size 1440px banner, the logo will automatically scale to narrower widths (such 1200px wide or 1024px wide) File size should be 250kb or less Can be JPG or PNG (PNG recommended for logos) Images Including images in your Explore page is simple and they're a great way to link folks to pages within your school's website. Pro-Tip: for the most consistency in your template (or any email or other template) it's a good idea to check your image sizing before loading them into Finalsite Enrollment. If you upload images that are the same size, your template will look a little cleaner. In this example, we're going to walk through adding inside a table as a trick to format them nicely. We'll also make those images clickable so that parents can get right to your webpage. How to use a table to nicely format images (and make those images into hyperlinks): Part 1: Adding your images within a table: Select the table icon. Select the number of rows for the table. In the example below, we wanted to add 3, nicely spaced images for a good clean look so we included 3 rows. Click into one of the rows and select the image icon to insert your image into the table. If you get a \"file is too large\" error message it means that you need to reduce the size of the image before trying again. Repeat by adding images to the other two rows. Click on the table (not the images) and use the edit options to remove the table boarder for a cleaner look. Always save your changes by clicking Save in the template. Here's a pro tip: Use this same method to cleanly display a row of text within your template as seen in the GIF below. Part 2: Making your images clickable: Click on one of your images within the table. Select the Insert Link option and add your link. Be sure to click \"Open in a new tab\" when adding the link. Repeat with each photo in the table so that when each is clicked, it will bring parents to the page you've linked. Always save your changes by clicking Save in the template. Text Edits You can edit the text within your template so that it stands out in some areas where you'd like to draw attention to it. When it comes to editing text, you can change the header style, color, font size, and font of the text in your template. You can even use the link option to hyperlink your text so that it takes the parent to the webpage of your choice. In this example, we'll walk you through adding headers and adjusting their color within your template. Highlight the text that you'd like to edit. Select the paragraph icon to choose a format. In this example, I've used the Heading 2 option for my header text. Select the text color icon to choose a color. In this example, I've inserted a hex code so that I could use a specific color. Always save your changes by clicking Save in the template. Layout Example 1 In this section and the one below, we'll look closer at two example layouts that you can follow to design your template page. For the first example, the school uses a banner at the top with a brief descriptive text area underneath followed by a three-image table with text and links underneath. Hint: You can use the same method described above to insert a table and then include text within each row. You can then make the table hidden for a clean look. Use this code to get started with the above template! Copy the code below and paste it into your Shared Portal Page template (within the Parent Portal Content page). Use the text within the template to guide where to add your Banner, Intro Text, Image Table, and Contact Links. Tips Erase the text at the top and upload your banner image there. Update the text below the banner to a heading title for the intro paragraph below. Use the text area below to enter some introductory text about your school. In the first table section below that, erase the text in the table sections one by one and upload an image into each of the sections. In the second table section, erase the template text and include a title and then a description for each of the three table sections. Optionally, hyperlink the titles to link families to pages on your website. At the bottom, change the text in the links area to represent the page you are linking to and turn each or some of them into a hyperlink. &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sa-assets-production/file_resources/6d884a65-ff88-11eb-81f5-02d5c4214917/3ee91a5e-2297-11ef-8289-66f0d9220171.png?1717521846\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h1 style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; color: rgb(27, 29, 77);'&gt; Title (replace with your intro title)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt; &lt;span style='font-size: 18px; font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif;'&gt; Replace this text with an intro paragraph about your school.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;table class=\"fr-no-borders\" style=\"width: 100%; margin-left: calc(0%);\"&gt; &lt;tbody&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sa-assets-production/file_resources/6d884a65-ff88-11eb-81f5-02d5c4214917/4cbea612-2297-11ef-9c61-22dfce22ab79.png?1717521869\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sa-assets-production/file_resources/6d884a65-ff88-11eb-81f5-02d5c4214917/55447faa-2297-11ef-8e81-be63cfdb056b.png?1717521883\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=\"width: 33.3333%;\"&gt;&lt;img src=\"https://s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/sa-assets-production/file_resources/6d884a65-ff88-11eb-81f5-02d5c4214917/5c303df4-2297-11ef-905d-2e4c760dfc2c.png?1717521895\" class=\"fr-fic fr-dib\"&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td style=\"width: 33.3333%; padding: 10px; vertical-align: text-top;\"&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; font-size: 18px; color: rgb(27, 29, 77);'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Table Section 1 Title Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;Enter short description here. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=\"width: 33.3333%; padding: 10px; vertical-align: text-top;\"&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; font-size: 18px; color: rgb(27, 29, 77);'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Table Section 2 Title Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;Enter short description here. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;td style=\"width: 33.3333%; padding: 10px; vertical-align: text-top;\"&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: \"Times New Roman\", Times, serif; font-size: 18px; color: rgb(27, 29, 77);'&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter Table Section 3 Title Here&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;br&gt;Enter short description here. &lt;br&gt; &lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/tbody&gt; &lt;/table&gt; &lt;p&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt; &lt;p style=\"text-align: center;\"&gt;&lt;span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"&gt; ENTER LINK 1 TITLE&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"&gt; ENTER LINK 2 TITLE&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span style=\"font-size: 16px;\"&gt; ENTER LINK 3 TITLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Layout Example 2 For this second example, the school uses a banner at the top, followed by descriptive text and then another 3 image table with hyperlinked images, and, at the bottom of the page, they've included links to different pages within their school's webpage. Use this code to get started with the above template! Copy the code below and paste it into your Shared Portal Page template (within the Parent Portal Content page).

    "body": "Overview Setting up a test student and connecting them to a test FACTS account is a great way to make sure your integration is working as expected before sending out contracts. It also allows you to keep tabs on it throughout the year to check on any errors/make sure it's working as expected if anything has changed. In this Article Set Up Your Test Student/Parent in Finalsite Enrollment Use Your Test Student to create a Test FACTS Account Troubleshooting Parent Issues Set Up Your Test Student/Parent in Finalsite Enrollment The first step is to make sure you have a test student set up in Finalsite Enrollment. Use this article to guide you in the initial step of adding a test student: Creating a Test Student Setup Tips Remember to use the word \"Test\" in their name when you add your student. This ensures that you can easily find them and prevents confusion as to whether or not they are a real student. Make sure your test kiddo doesn't have any siblings attached to them (it will be easier to test FACTS without siblings). If they have a sibling attached, make sure the sibling is also in an Enrollment in Progress status or that they are placed in an inactive status. (Inactive statuses: Parent declined, Application withdrawn, Denied, or any custom admissions statuses that are marked as 'inactive'.) Next, follow these steps to finish their setup: Step 1. Go to their record. Once you have your test student set up, navigate to their record. Step 2. Update their status. Change the test student to an Enrollment in Progress status. (Edit &gt; Change Status for xxxx-xxxx &gt; Enrollment &gt; Enrollment in Progress) Step 3. Check for rules on your FACTS checklist item. Sometimes schools have rules attached to their FACTS checklist item to designate who it should show for or when it should show. Open the Enrollment Checklist and open the FACTS checklist item. If there are rules attached to the checklist item, adjust your test student to make sure they meet the criteria for the FACTS item to show. If there are no rules attached to your FACTS checklist item, proceed to the next step. Step 4: Assign Financial responsibility and save the Authentication code. Back on the test student record, navigate to the Parent Portal Access tab. Click on the financial split column next to the test parent that you are going to authenticate to. Assign 100% financial responsibility to that test parent. While on this page, copy the Authentication Code of the test parent and save it to a note. Step 5: Contract Submission. Navigate back to the Summary tab of the student record (where the checklist is) and click the checkbox to submit the student's contract. You don't need to generate it in this case. Just click the checkbox and enter the required selections to submit it. Authenticate yourself Now that you've set up the student, you will authenticate yourself to the test account and view the student's checklist from the parent portal side of things. Remember the authentication code you saved? You are going to need it now. Open the username menu and select Parent Portal . In the Parent Portal, select to enter an Authentication code. Paste in the saved code and save it by clicking Next. You'll see you're test student appear. Note: If you already have a test student in there, you'll see the authentication code entry link at the bottom of the page. Check on the FACTS checklist item Click on the student's checklist to check that the FACTS checklist item is available (the button is clickable). If the checklist item is not there: Check on the checklist item rules again. Did you need to set answers in any other fields to make the FACTS checklist item show up on the checklist? If the checklist item is not clickable: Check on your test student. Is the contract submitted? For the FACTS item to be available, you need to submit that checklist item. Does your test student have siblings? For this to work all siblings must be in either an Enrollment in Progress status or set to have inactive statuses. See the Setup tips above. Here's what you should see if everything is working as expected. Use your test student to create a test FACTS account Now we're ready to move into FACTS. Click on the FACTS checklist item. If it's your first time in FACTS, you'll be asked to enter contact information to set up your account. It's okay to enter fake information here since you are setting up this account for testing purposes. When you see the multifactor authentication option, just skip it by clicking Maybe Later . Once you do that you'll be brought to the entry screen. If you have an error in the setup, it will show here. If you see an error here, take a screenshot and contact the support team to let us know. We'll be able to help you fix it. Here's an example of what the process looks like (if you see an error on the home page). If you don't see an error like in the example above, you'll be able to select Begin and you'll see the parent experience with the fees that have been sent over. Check out this video for a peek into what the experience looks like from a parent's perspective: FACTS Web-provided Parent Experience. Troubleshooting Parent Issues When a parent runs into an error message on the FACTS end, you may not be able to see the error by using the Impersonate feature in Finalsite Enrollment. There's a possibility you'll be blocked by an authentication requirement. Here's what we recommend: First, try to see the FACTS error by impersonating the parent. If you are not blocked by multi-factor authentication, you should be able to see an error message toward the top of the screen. Take a screenshot or write down the exact error message and send it to our team so that investigate further. If you are blocked by a requirement to authenticate, we recommend the following: Ask the parent exactly what the error message says and have them send you a screenshot of the error if possible. Send the error message language and (when applicable) a screenshot of the error to our Support team. We'll work with FACTS and your school to help ensure that the error is clear! Keeping an eye on errors on your end We recommend that you create a test student in Finalsite Enrollment and set yourself up as their parent with a test account on the FACTS side. You can use this to make sure your FACTS account is set up correctly. Ideally, you should make sure to use this test student to check your integration before sending out contracts to ensure that your families won't run into any preventable issues. Some common issues and what they mean: Term Code Error: This means FACTS has not enabled the term or the active terms do not match in Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS. Contact our team for support. Account Code Error: This means there is a code or codes that do not match in Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS. Contact our team for support. Grade Error: This means that the grade doesn't match in FACTS with the way that it's written in Finalsite Enrollment. For example, we may list a grade as \"K\" in Finalsite Enrollment, which is listed as \"Kindergarten\" in FACTS. Contact our team for support. The FACTS button is hidden on the checklist: This one can be managed on your end! The FACTS link will be hidden if any siblings are still in an active admissions status (regardless of their term). Manage this by moving all kids in the family to either an Enrollment status with a completed contract or an 'inactive' Admissions status.

    "body": "Overview Emails may occasionally get lost due to different email server settings. To ensure that you and your family receive emails from your Finalsite Enrollment site without any issues, here's what you need to know to prevent any emails from being lost. Read on for more! In this Article Finalsite Enrollment Email Address Preventing Missing Emails Parent Help Finalsite Enrollment Email Address Expand each dropdown to learn more. Making the Sender Clear Within your Communication Setup page (Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Setup) you can ensure that emails coming from your Finalsite Enrollment site are clear to the receiver. Make sure your school name is in the Email From textbox. This will show before the email address in the From field of an email. Example of the sender info for emails coming from your site: \"Claire's Training Academy\" &lt;info+schoolname@fsenrollment.com&gt; Emails start with the name entered in the Email From box on your Communication Setup Page within quotations. Next, within the \"&lt;&gt;\", the emails start with \"info+\" followed by your school domain name. After the \"@\" symbol, receivers will see: fsenrollment.com What does my email sender information look like? Here are a couple of ways to check what appears in the \"From\" section of an email coming from your site: Check any of the notification emails you've received from the site. If you receive any user notification emails such as the Daily Activity Summary, you can look at the sender info to see what emails coming from your site look like. The example below is from Gmail and the highlight box shows where you would find the sender. Please note that it's only blurred for privacy reasons. You'll see the whole email on your end. Check the sent emails section of the Contact Record When you open the details of any of the emails within a contact record, you'll also be able to see the sender information in the \"From\" field at the top of the email. Check Failed Emails As a best practice, keep an eye on your Failed Emails page (Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Failed Emails). This page lists all the emails from your site that have failed to send. If a parent marked the communication as SPAM, you'll see that noted in the failure reason, and, in some cases, you may want to clarify this with the particular family. See the Failed Emails article for more insight into error messages on that page. Preventing Missing Emails If you or one of your families is not receiving emails as expected, email settings might be the culprit. It's a good idea to check spam settings and ensure that @fsenrollment.com is considered a safe and recognized sender. Ensuring that emails don't get sent to spam is called Whitelisting. Here's a great resource on how to whitelist emails from Hubspot. You can also follow the instructions below to ensure that emails don't hit the spam folder. Each email server is a little different so we've compiled a resource list of how to check email settings on some of the major servers.

Here's an interactive tutorial ** Best experienced in Full Screen (click the icon in the top right corner before you begin) ** https://www.iorad.com/player/2364033/How-to-Pass-ACH-Convenience-Fees-to-Parents Important You can see your school's specific rates on the Payments page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments.) Anytime you update the convenience fee, check that the confirmation Message has been updated to contain the correct information. It is displayed on a parent's screen when submitting a payment, so the text in the Message box must be updated to match your fee. Both the Credit Card and Electronic Check tabs have a message box like the one below. Updating the fees that you are sending out to parents automatically triggers the Rate Change email to be sent. Read more about that in our Parent Experience section below. Parent Experience Parent Portal In the Parent Portal, parents can find the convenience fee rates listed at the top left of the Billing Management tab. Important to note These will only display if you have set a rate up on the Payment Setup page. For example, if you are only passing along a 3.05% convenience fee for Credit Cards and have not set up any Electronic Check fees to be passed along to parents, then only the credit card note will display. Some of the language within these notes comes from what you have written on the Payment Setup page . The Fee Description language and rate are used in the message. Here's an example of the credit card note with placeholders to show where the language is added: Please note: a {whatever you put in the fee description will show here} of {whatever your rate is will be listed here} will be applied to all Credit Card payments. Contract Adding Convenience Fee information to the Deposit Instructions template will alert parents to the additional charge as well as any other important information you need them to know. You can edit that template under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Content &gt; Deposit Instructions. The language included in that template is displayed above the payment information section on the contract. Email When you update the convenience fees that you are passing along to parents, the Rate Change email is sent out. When you click save after adjusting the rate on either the Credit Card or Electronic Check tabs, you'll see a pop-up window asking you to acknowledge that the email will be sent. Who is the email sent to? This email is automatically sent to affected parents who have autopay enabled. It's sent based on what you update and is only sent to applicable parents with autopay enabled. For example: If you only update the Credit Card convenience fee, only parents with a Credit Card saved to autopay will be emailed. In addition, the email is only sent to active accounts. Active accounts are those that either have: An upcoming charge that will be pulled in the next autopay cycle. Or, an unpaid past charge that will be pulled in the next autopay cycle. This way, parents who are no longer active with the school but may still have autopay enabled on their end will not receive the email. What happens if I click Close instead of Confirm? The rate change that you made will not be saved and the email will not be sent. Where can I update the Rate Change email? It can be updated on the Billing Email templates page: Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails Convenience Fee Agreement and Notification Messages If you have enabled the convenience fee notification messages for credit cards and electronic checks, parents will see your confirmation language and will be required to agree to it on any form that includes a payment page.

    "body": "Overview Using Finalsite\u2019s content management system (CMS) in conjunction with Finalsite\u2019s enrollment management system (EMS) provides the optimal experience for parents and school administrators alike. Read this article to get a basic, high-level view of the integration and how it works. There is no charge for this integration! In this Article What does the CMS integration do? What happens when the CMS integration is set up? How do I request it? The basics of the CMS/EMS journey Major Best Practices FAQs Terms used in this article For the purpose of streamlining this article you will see two terms used to refer to our two systems CMS (Content Management System) - This refers to Finalsite\u2019s website, marketing and communication tools (known as Finalsite Composer, Messages and Workflows). EMS (Enrollment Management System) - This refers to Finalsite\u2019s admissions, enrollment and tuition management platform. What does the CMS integration do? The integration with CMS sends contacts (and information about them) from EMS to CMS. In CMS, they are grouped by status so that you can use them to build communications and Workflows. What happens when the CMS integration is set up? Pre-Integration Setup You'll work with your a member of the CMS team to request to turn on and set up the integration. During the setup, the CMS team will provide you with a data mapping guide to identify which fields you'd like to send from EMS to CMS. The integration can send over demographic information. In addition to that you'll also have the opportunity to specify up to 10 custom fields to send over. When your setup is complete, the CMS training team will provide you with the option to attend a 1-hour training to cover the integration. When the integration is set up... Contacts will flow from EMS into CMS. In CMS, these contacts are stored in Constituent Manager and the data updates approximately every hour with a full refresh overnight. Pro Tip: You won't really use Constituent Manager to manage these contacts in your day-to-day work, this is just where the data goes/is stored in CMS. You may use Constituent Manager to make adjustments if something in the data is off/needs adjusting. In CMS, you will use Group Manager to create groups of students for messaging. You can first create a top-level group, for example, \"Admissions Communications\", and, within that group, you can add subgroups filtered to meet your needs. You can use Dynamic filters to narrow down these subgroups. For example, you might create a group of all International students who are in the Inquiry status. Next, in CMS, you can use the groups you created to build drip campaigns using messages and Workflows. Use those campaigns to nurture families toward inquiring and applying. How do I request it? Start by getting in touch with CMS support to let them know you are interested! The basics of the CMS/EMS journey Prospect Phase During the Prospect phase you can: Use a Leadflow form (embedded on your CMS site) to gather prospects. Create a drip campaign using CMS Workflows to nurture the prospects toward to inquiry form. Inquiry Phase During the Inquiry Phase you can: Embed your EMS Inquiry form into your CMS website to gather inquiries. Nurture families towards applying with CMS Workflows. Applicant/Enrollment Phase During the Applicant/Enrollment Phase you can: Once the family applies, you should use EMS to nudge them along the journey of completing checklist items and making it the enrollment finish line. Communication at this stage should come through EMS. You may use CMS to share communications unrelated to admissions/enrollment such as communicating about a school sports event. Basically, at this stage, you can ask: Are we communicating about checklist items? If so, that's communication should come through EMS! Or, are we communicating about school events unrelated to the checklist progress? That's a CMS communication! Post Enrollment After the student is fully enrolled, you can: Essentially, this is when you move your workflow back into CMS. You can use CMS for enrollment and community engagement, such as: New Student Workflow (nurturing/community side) Community Messaging Portals Major Best Practices Create an internal communication roadmap. Why is this important? When using the integration you will be working together cross-departmentally. Admissions and Enrollment teams will use Finalsite Enrollment to support the journey of students in the Admissions/Enrollment cycle, while other teams, like marketing perhaps, will be working on the CMS side to build nurturing campaigns that draw students in. A clear communication roadmap shared across all teams is essential so that teams know what communication is being sent out, when it's being sent, and who is sending it. This doesn't have to be anything fancy. It can be as simple as something written up in a Google doc. Create a drip campaign to nurture families! Pro-Tips on creating a more effective Drip campaign in CMS. Keep it short, it should span a couple of weeks. (Don't go over a month) ALWAYS include a Call to Action Example CMS drip campaign plan: Message 1: Message about the benefits of attending your institution. CALL TO ACTION to the Inquiry. Message 2: Message about the different athletics and extracurriculars: CALL TO ACTION to the Inquiry. Message 3: Message about volunteer and community engagement: CALL TO ACTION to the Inquiry. Message 4: Final call to receive additional info and sign up for open houses: CALL TO ACTION to the inquiry. And, last but not least: Keep your EMS landing pages and communications branded and beautiful! FAQs Once the integration is turned on by our teams, are there any manual steps to getting EMS data into CMS? Nope! Once it is all set up, it's automatic. The student/parent data will be sent to CMS and the system will refresh the data every hour. Where can I see the spreadsheet that you are provided by your CSM when selecting data mapping to CMS? Here's a copy of the spreadsheet! You are sent this by the CMS team once the integration is set up. They use it to help you identify the fields you'd like to send from EMS to CMS. Does everyone who turns on the integration get a personalized data mapping guide? Yep! Every customer who is setting up the EMS/CMS integration will be given a mapping guide. Here's a copy of the spreadsheet! If I can't find the data mapping guide, who should I contact? If you can't locate your mapping guide, you can connect with you CMS Client Success Manager. Do custom statuses get mapped over? Yep! Whatever statuses you have at the time the integration is set up will map over. If you add a status after that point, they will not automatically be mapped over. You can connect with Finalsite Support (CMS ) if you need to update your status list in CMS. How often does the integration update? The integration updates every hour with a full refresh nightly! Can you build a workflow with a Leadflow form? You sure can! It\u2019s a nice follow-up too. You can set up the Workflow to stop if students enter something like the inquired status. What workflow goals would be best for tracking EMS + CMS progress? Workflows set up around statuses work really well. For example, a workflow can be built to nurture students to inquire or apply. Workflows can be set up to stop based on the student moving into a status on the EMS end. For example, if the student becomes an Applicant, that application Workflow can be set up to stop going out to that family, Is there a limit to the number of custom fields you can map to CMS? Yep, CMS will allow 10 custom fields to be mapped over. Keep in mind, that's on top of the fields that CMS already can send over as defined in the data spreadsheet . So, a bunch of basic demographic info gets sent over and then, if you needs anything else, you can send up to 10 fields of your choosing. This is all covered in the work you do with your CSM when setting up the integration, you will communicate what they'd like to send over at that time.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite's CMS and EMS can be connected to share data from Finalsite Enrollment into your Finalsite CMS database to facilitate communications from the Messages and Workflows modules. The goal of this integration is to use both systems for what they are best at. Finalsite Enrollment is your central hub for admissions and enrollment management (EMS), while Finalsite\u2019s robust communication tools can be used to push inquiries through the admissions process (CMS). There is no charge for this integration! In this Article How it works Setup and deployment Important notes Terms used in this article To streamline this article, you will see two terms used to refer to our two systems CMS (Content Management System) - This refers to Finalsite\u2019s website, marketing, and communication tools (known as Finalsite Composer, Messages, and Workflows). EMS (Enrollment Management System) - This refers to Finalsite\u2019s admissions, enrollment, and tuition management platform. How it works When the integration is enabled, parent/student data will flow one way from EMS into CMS. The sync will run hourly to update the information in Finalsite, with a full refresh nightly. Constituent Manager When the parent/student data first comes over from CMS, they all land in Constituent Manager . It's not likely that you'll need to use this in your day-to-day work but you may need to come here if you notice anything off in a student's data that you'd like to adjust. Group Manager You'll also find the students and parents listed in Group Manager. Here they will be listed based on the status of the student. Additionally, there will be a corresponding group for relatives of those applicants, to facilitate targeting the parents/guardians with your communications. Good to know vocab: \"Contacts\" and \"Students\" in CMS In Finalsite Composer, you'll see the groups divided into \"SchoolAdmin Contacts\" and \"SchoolAdmin Students\". Contacts are the parents. and Students are the students. So, when you are building a contact list in Group Manager, if you pull in \"School Admin Contacts\", you are pulling in a list of the parents. You can add groups within Group Manager so that you can use dynamic filters to narrow down your pool of contacts in order to more effectively engage with them. For example, you may be building a group of Inquiries who are also International students so that you can create a drip campaign in Workflows specifically targeted to nurturing International students to apply. Data Notes Users from the Finalsite Enrollment integration will not automatically merge users already in Finalsite. If a user from Finalsite Enrollment already exists in Constituent Manager, a duplicate user will be created. You can clean up CMS duplicates on your end, or you can reach out to CMS support if you need a hand! If you adjust the statuses configured in Finalsite Enrollment, please reach out to Finalsite Support to re-align the mapping, so the sync will continue to work as expected. We treat the student/parent data going from EMS to CMS cyclically. The intended purpose is to populate and update the data throughout your admissions season, then purge and start fresh at the beginning of the next season. Best practices Create a Leadflow form to add to your Finalsite website. Use this form to gather prospects that will be sent to EMS. Use your Finalsite website to drive interested parties to your Finalsite Enrollment inquiry form, where they will be \u201cpicked up\u201d by the integration. Nurture those inquiries using Workflows or Messages and get them to apply using your Finalsite Enrollment application. Follow up with those applicants using Messages or Workflows. Create targeted segments with the data you have available to tailor information specifically to the recipient. Setup and deployment If you are interested in this integration, please reach out to the CMS Finalsite Support team or your client success manager to work with a deployment specialist who will walk you through the necessary steps, including: Granting access to the Finalsite Enrollment API Configuring the data mapping Verifying the data (on a clone site or live site) Enabling and automating the integration on your live site We have a wide range of datapoints available that can be mapped into Finalsite, according to your needs. The best practice is to only import data that is required \u2014 like ImportID values, first and last names, email addresses, relationships \u2014 as well as data that is useful for your communication efforts and allows you to filter for segments you want to target (such as grade applying for, financial aid requested, or custom fields). Also during the deployment process, you may want to work with our team on configuring your workflows or mailing lists to ensure they are behaving as expected. Important notes Constituents and groups created from the integration are largely hidden in Finalsite. This is intentional, as we don\u2019t want constituents to be treated as portal users or to be manually edited in Finalsite. Likewise, the groups that the integration creates should not be edited manually, as it can compromise the behavior of the integration. Groups should also not be created in the same \u201cnodes\u201d as the system-level groups the integration created. These groups can be used for mailing list targets or to create other groups via dynamic filters, however, as your organization requires. Please note: If you wish to utilize Finalsite Enrollment data to update your active Parents and Students, this can be done in an automated fashion, although it is a different approach than the integration described in this article. Please reach out to your Client Success Manager, who can connect you with Support for deployment of this integration. If at all possible, we do not recommend that you utilize an SIS integration for this purpose, but we understand that, sometimes, Finalsite Enrollment will have the best data. As admissions seasons can vary from school to school, we urge you to coordinate with our Finalsite CMS Support team at the end of your admissions season to clean up the data in CMS and prepare for the next admissions season. Users who are removed from Finalsite Enrollment can be removed from Finalsite using our Off Feed Utility and the automation option.

    "body": "Overview Our team assists in managing various aspects of your Contract Fees page. Reach out to us to handle the following tasks: Setting up new contract fees Establishing new rules for contract fees Modifying existing contract fee rules Refer to this guide to understand the information we require for seamless updates tailored to your needs! In this Article Adding a New Contract Fee Adding a Contract Fee Rule Editing a Contract Fee Rule Adding a New Contract Fee When you'd like us to add a new contract fee for you, we'll need to know the following about your new fee: Name: What do you want the fee to be called? The name shows on the contract and in the parent's ledgers. Billing Category: What Billing Category should the fee be assigned to? Amount Type (fixed amount, field, or percentage) Will the fee be a fixed amount ? (ex. $10.0) Will the fee come from an amount you enter into a field ? If so, what field should we connect the fee to? Should the fee be a percentage of other charges? If so, we need to know how you'd like the percentage set up. See the percentages table below for more details. Charge Type (deposit, optional fee, payment plan fee required fee, tuition, tuition discount) What type of charge is this? See the charge type table below for more details. Amount (doesn't apply to field-based fees because you set the amount of those within the field itself) What amount or percentage should the fee be? Explanation Would you like any text added to explain the fee? This shows on the contract right under the fee. Allow Payer-Specific Overrides? (does not apply to deposit fees) Opting to Allow Payer-Specific Overrides on a contract fee means that you can manually set the amount each financially responsible payer will owe for a fee or is granted for any discount. Add to Deposit? (only applies to required fees, payment plan fees, and optional fees) Would you like this fee added to the deposit so that it can be collected at the time of contract signing? Contract Fee Rule Does your contract fee apply to all students or only some of them? If it applies to all students, no rule is necessary. If applies to a group of students, however, we need to add a rule to tell it who to look for. If you need a rule applied to the fee, please include those details with your request. For more info, see the Contract Fee Rule section below. When you've gathered all the info, contact our team with the details and we'll add your new fee! Percentages Table Percentage fees are calculated based on other charges. Depending on the type of charge, your options vary. The chart below contains your options based on the type of charge. Example: If you are adding a new required fee that's percentage-based, you'll need to decide if you want it to be a percentage of Tuition, Financial Aid Amount (-), and/or Scholarship Amount (-). You can choose one of those, a mix of those, or all of them. Deposit Fee Optional Fee Payment Plan Fee Required Fee Tuition Discount Tuition Tuition Tuition Tuition Tuition Required Fees Required Fees Required Fees Required Fees Financial Aid Amount (-) Financial Aid Amount (-) Financial Aid Amount (-) Financial Aid Amount (-) Financial Aid Amount (-) Scholarship Amount (-) Scholarship Amount (-) Scholarship Amount (-) Scholarship Amount (-) Scholarship Amount (-) Tuition Discounts (-) Tuition Discounts (-) Deposit (-) Charge Type Table You'll need to identify what type of fee you'd like your new fee to be. * = You have the option to add this type of fee to the deposit. + = You have the option to allow payer-specific overrides with this fee. Deposit Fee The amount charged on the contract to secure enrollment. Read more in our Deposit article. (If you are a billing school, check out our Billing: Deposit article instead) Optional Fee* + These are fees that families can opt into on the contract. Read about them in our Required &amp; Optional Fees article. Payment Plan Fee* + These are fees that will be attached to one or more of your payment plans. Check out our Payment Plans Overview article to learn about Payment Plans. Required Fee* + These are fees that the family is required to pay. Read about them in our Required &amp; Optional Fees article. Tuition The amount charged for tuition. Read more in our Tuition &amp; Tuition Discounts article. Tuition Discount + The amount of discount applied to the contract. Read more in our Tuition &amp; Tuition Discounts article. Adding a Contract Fee Rule Contract Fee Rules tell Contract Fees how to work. They look at the field data on student records to determine whether or not the fee applies to them. Contract fees can have a variety of rules attached to them to home in on a specific group. For example: all 3rd graders who are also returning students. Whether you are adding a rule to an existing contract fee or you need a rule attached to a new fee, we'll need to know the following: Who does the fee apply to? We just need to know the exact group that should see the fee. For example, does it only apply to certain grades? We'll do the work of adding the right rules, all we need from you is insight as to which group it should apply to. Common Examples of Contract Fee rule usage: This fee only applies to certain grades. This fee only applies to those who have said yes to a question on the contract. This fee only applies to international students. This discount only applies to siblings. This is only for returning students. Or, this is only for new students. When you know what you need, contact our team with the details and we'll add your new rule! Editing a Contract Fee Rule Whenever you need an update to a contract fee rule, just send us the details of what you need to be added or changed about the current setup and we'll take care of the rest. When you know what you need, contact our team with the details and we'll edit your rule!

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Explore allows families to manage their school search and application process from one location. With the assistance of our team, you can enable Finalsite Explore, offering families a more streamlined experience when it comes to searching for and applying to schools! In this article, we'll cover the behind-the-scenes setup for Explore. In this Article Site Setup Finalsite Explore Content Explore Page Data Setup Order of schools in your group list URLs Ethnicity Gender Option to exclude: Gender, Ethnicity, and Household From Finalsite Explore to Finalsite Enrollment: How information is collected and transferred to your site Inquiries Application Grades Terms Field Mapping Site Setup Finalsite Explore Content On the Finalsite Explore Content page (under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Finalsite Explore Content), you'll update key information identifying your school in Finalsite Explore. (Only those designated as System Admins or Admins in your site can access this page.) Check it out! Be sure to check out our dedicated article about the Explore Content Page: Finalsite Explore Content Finalsite Explore Page On the Parent Portal Content page ( under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Content &gt; Finalsite Explore Page), you'll update the design of the main area that shows when a parent selects to explore your school. Check it out! Be sure to check out our dedicated article on setting up your Explore page: Finalsite Explore: Designing a Great Explore Page . Data Setup Order of schools in your group list Did you know that you can choose the order in which schools appear in your school group list? Changing the order of the schools in your list is something we manage on our end. If you'd like to adjust the order in which the schools in your group appear, please contact our support team. URLs Learn about the URLs you can share with prospective families to give them access to Finalsite Explore in our Finalsite Explore Access article. We also have the option for your group to set up a custom subdomain. This allows you to link families directly to your group list. (They bypass the step of selecting a school group that they would encounter with the regular link and they go right to the list of schools in your group.) Custom Subdomains can be set up (or changed) at any time. Learn more about them here: Custom Subdomain for Finalsite Explore. Ethnicity During the setup, your group will need to decide on which ethnicity values to display in the Student Information form. You can list whatever options your group agrees on and our team will add them to your form. This is an internal setting. Your group can request updates to the ethnicity options on your Finalsite Explore Information form at any point by contacting support. Where do parents encounter this? When a parent first creates an account in Finalsite Explore, they will be prompted to complete the Student Information form providing basic information on the student/family. If it's not excluded, ethnicity will be a question that appears on this form. Gender You can choose from the following gender options to include: Female, Male, Non-Binary, Self-Identify, Prefer Not To Answer. You can list all or part of these options in the Finalsite Explore Student Information form. This is an internal setting. Your group can request updates to the gender options on your Finalsite Explore Information form at any point by contacting support. Where do parents encounter this? When a parent first creates an account in Finalsite Explore, they will be prompted to complete the Student Information form providing basic information on the student/family. If it's not excluded, gender will be a question that appears on this form. Option to exclude: Gender, Ethnicity, and Household Gender, Ethnicity, and Household can be set as optional or excluded altogether from the Student Information form (the form parents complete when they first create an account in Finalsite Explore) and within the My Profile page (where parents can add/update info). This is an internal setting. Your group can request an update to this at any time by contacting our support team . From Finalsite Explore to Finalsite Enrollment: How information is collected and transferred to your site Inquiries When a parent chooses More Information* their inquiry automatically is sent to your school in the background. *Please note: the More Information is only available after account creation/login. If you visit Finalsite Explore through the Browsing without an Account option, you will not see the More Information option. You will, however, still see the Apply Now option. Here's what happens: For Parents: Clicking More Information directs them to the URL provided under Explore Content. On the Backend: An inquiry is dispatched to your school, containing the information gathered when the parent completed the Student Information form . Application When a parent clicks the Apply Now button in Finalsite Explore, they'll fill out your school's application form. Any information collected in the Student Information form will pre-populate into the application. Keep the following in mind: When applying, parents will have to complete any additional fields on your application that are not on the Student Information form. Reminder: parents only need to submit answers for questions marked as required within a form. Application Fees remain the same. If you are set up to collect one , parents will be prompted to pay one just as they would if accessing your application from your site or parent portal. Grades When setting up Finalsite Explore, you'll select your school's grades on your Finalsite Explore Content page. Here's what you need to know about grade data in Finalsite Explore: Grades marked as unavailable* *To learn more about setting Grades as unavailable, check out our Grades article. On the application Grades marked as unavailable on your site don't pre-populate for parents on the application. In other words, when they go to select the grade they are applying for in the application form, if you have set the grade as unavailable (collect applications toggled to \"No\") , they will not see the grade as an option in the dropdown. In the Student Information Form Grades marked as unavailable ( collect applications toggled to \"No\" ) in Finalsite Enrollment do appear as options in the Student Information form in Finalsite Explore. If a grade is marked as unavailable in your site , and the parent selects that grade as the grade they are applying to when completing the student information form, the 'grade applying to' section on the application will be blank. The parent will not see the unavailable grade in the list of options and they'll be required to select from any of the other grades that you are accepting applications for. What's the takeaway? If you mark grades as unavailable, consider adding a note to the application so that parents are aware you are not accepting applications for that grade level. Terms To make sure that you successfully capture student terms in Finalsite Explore, you need to make sure that the Start Year matches the Finalsite Explore format (XXXX). To do this: Go to Settings &gt; General &gt; Terms and verify the format of your Start Years. The format should be XXXX . For example, 2025 . Important If your Start Years do not match this format, please contact support before making any changes because altering term formats could disrupt existing integrations with other systems. Field Mapping Expand each of the following drop-downs to learn how fields are mapped from the Student Information form to your application. As a reminder, the Student Information form is the form that parents complete when they create a Finalsite Explore account for the first time. Data Mapping of Student/Address fields.

Get in touch now by emailing courtney.single@finalsite.com Key Themes &amp; Best Practices General Themes Start small, and dream big! The system is robust, and you can only do so much in your first year. (Hint: You\u2019re doing great and this is right where you should be). For everything else, keep it on your \u2018wish list\u2019 so you don\u2019t forget it, but can revisit these items when you have time. Chart Your Course and Goal Set. Document your wish list of items you\u2019d like to incorporate into your process so that you can add them in as you have bandwidth. You need a clearly defined map and goals. Have backup for key/time-sensitive tasks so that all knowledge doesn\u2019t exist with one person. Example: When possible, it\u2019s good to have a backup person to import Inquiry and Application forms and to review/merge duplicate records so that families aren\u2019t held up in the process. You might be out of the office or away from your desk and this will keep things streamlined. Utilize your internal work calendar to set reminders of important dates/tasks for your workflows. Examples: Add new Open House/Tour dates to the Inquiry Form and Website. Remove events from the Inquiry Form and Website that have passed, or add messaging that the event will resume the following year or re-open at a certain time. Set a date to send decision communications or generate contracts. Set a reminder to create or update time-sensitive automated communication plans before the Admissions or Enrollment season. Set up any APIs or Export Files you need. Areas of Focus: Best Practices Communications Add basic branding of all communications with a pre-sized banner/logo, warm messaging, and contact information. Inquiry and Application Landing Pages should include warm messaging, calls to action, website links, or social media links. Customize and brand your System Emails, Authentication Emails, Recommendation Emails, and Billing Emails (if you have this module). Custom Emails Create information-based and interest-based emails such as inquiry touch points, an email for financial aid information, send the admissions/enrollment checklist completion reminder emails we provide, customize the enrollment/contract information email with these best practices, and more. Events Include at least one or two events hosted on the Inquiry Form, website, and/or Inquiry/Admissions Checklist. Pro Tip: You can add multiple events to your Inquiry form, and then provide a link to the Inquiry form on each of these event pages on your website. This will create multiple access points to the same form. Build dynamic event confirmation and reminder emails with images/links to a campus map and directions, sign-in instructions, customized confirmation or reminder banners for each event, etc. Make sure every event calendar also has a checklist item created for the event and tied to the calendar for event registration and attendance tracking. Checklist Items Incorporate all of the current requirements and keep it streamlined for parents at the Application and Enrollment stages. Add \u2018parent explanation text\u2019 to every checklist item to ensure families know what the requirements are, any special circumstances for the requirement to be completed, and answer any common questions upfront. For event checklist items, let families know they\u2019ll receive a confirmation email upon registration and how many days you set the reminder email to go out that they\u2019ll receive. If you turn on the cancellation email, you can notify them about this communication as well if you\u2019d like. You can also let families know of any special steps they may need to take to change or cancel their registration. For recommendation or document request emails, you can let families know they won\u2019t have access to the submitted materials or documents, however, they will receive an email once everything has been submitted and the checklist item will then be marked complete in their portal. Create internal checklist items for your internal workflows such as \u2018send decisions\u2019 or \u2018verified transcripts/schools records.\u2019 You can have an internal \u2018interview/tour notes\u2019 form built that you fill out internally along the way. Reporting &amp; Data Request custom filter options for your Dashboard and list pages for daily/weekly reporting and action steps like sending more targeted communications. You can request these from the Support team! Some examples include Financial Aid requested? Yes/No, Program Selection, Interests, and more. Create custom-saved reports for efficiency. Make sure you have all of your export templates created and up to date for your SIS or other third-party systems by working with our Support Team. Make sure you have any needed APIs set up. Feature Adoption Checklist Inquiry Stage Design a dynamic Inquiry form with event registrations and Inquiry Checklist financial assistance yes/no. Branded &amp; Customized Inquiry Thank You, Landing Page . Branded &amp; Customized Inquiry Thank You Email . Inquiry Checklist with at least 3 Required Checklist Items. Utilize the Inquiry checklist to track your outreach and likelihood of application conversions through required checklist items. Best Practice: If you have more than one event, add them all as optional checklist items and have 1 required checklist item called \"Attended at least one campus event\" to track your personal interaction with them. The required checklist item is a way for you to track that you got the family to campus or virtually to an event and that they completed a \u2018visit.\u2019 They may attend more than one event which is great, but for your conversion rates, knowing that they attended at least one event vs none is important to gauge their interest. Setting all events as optional items, and one required checklist item to indicate they visited campus, allows you to use the \u201cInquiry Complete\u201d status to indicate the families that you feel confident will apply to your school. Anyone in an \u201cInquiry\u201d status would mean you either didn\u2019t complete a touch point on your checklist, or the family hasn\u2019t been to campus yet. See an example of how this is set up below and reach out to Support if you\u2019d like some guidance. Event Management (Inquiry/Application) Event Registration on Inquiry Form. Public Calendar Event Links on Website. Best Practice: Be mindful of the number of public calendar links you create, as each public calendar registration creates the attendee as a new Inquiry contact in the system. This may increase your need to review and merge duplicates in the system within your Forms Inbox. Pro Tip: Using the Inquiry form for event sign-ups streamlines everything into one place and allows families to sign up for multiple events in one form. This will reduce the amount of duplicate forms in your inbox. Branded &amp; Customized Event emails . Best Practice: Start small. Include your school banner or logo, key links to your website/social media or to a campus map, and a signature block. Make sure all events created within your Scheduling tab have an event checklist item created and tied to the event. Best Practice: Include parent explanation text to let families know they\u2019ll receive a confirmation email with event/appointment details and how many days before the event that they\u2019ll receive the reminder email. Please note, explanation text will be displayed at the Application or Enrollment stages only since families don\u2019t have an Inquiry checklist. Create Event Checklist Items for Applicants so parents can sign up directly within the portal. You also have options to allow families to reschedule or cancel themselves for events and to close registration within the parent portal a set number of days before the event. Event Thank you Emails - Manually send or automate event thank you emails through a custom automated communication plan. Communications Branded &amp; Customized Thank you landing pages for Inquiry and Application stages. Start small. Include warm messaging, contact information, and links to key pages on your website or social media. Branded &amp; Customized Thank You Emails for the Inquiry form, Application form, and submitted Contract form. Automated Checklist Reminder Emails for Applicants and/or Enrolling Students.

    "body": "Overview When creating an account, parents have two options: manually create an account with an email and password or utilize one of the Single Sign On options to create an account. Manual account creation requires parents to enter their name, an email address, and a password. Once created, and verified, the parent will continue to log in with the email and password combination that they input when they created their account. Single Sign On (SSO) through Google or Microsoft is automatically available to all parents when they log in. SSO simplifies parents' access, providing a seamless and efficient way to use our system. It enhances security and empowers parents, ensuring a more effective and streamlined enrollment cycle. Utilizing SSO does not require any additional internal setup. It's automatically available to parents when they are logging in. Did you know? Logins are the same across all Finalsite Enrollment Parent Portals. That means, if a parent has created an account before on another school's portal, they do not need to create another account, rather, they can log in with the same email/password or SSO in without creating a new account. In this Article Manual Account Creation and Login Single-Sign-On Account Creation and Login SSO FAQs Returning to log in Manual Account Creation and Login When opting to manually create their account, parents will start by selecting the Create an Account button on the login screen. First, the parent/guardian selects Create an Account. Next, the parent/guardian enters their name, email, and a password and selects 'Create Account.' When they select Create Account after entering their information, they are brought into the portal where they can complete an application o r authenticate to a student so that they can access/contribute to their admissions or enrollment checklist. Important: After creating their account, parents will receive an email with a verification link. Parents do gain immediate access to the portal when they create their account but they have to verify their email within 24 hours of account creation to maintain access to their account. The verification email is a non-customizable system email. Example of what the confirmation email looks like. This is a non-customizable system email. Resending the Verification Email If a parent needs another verification email sent to them, there are 2 options: The parent selects the resend option from their portal page. The admin sends the parent the verification email from the Parent Portal Accounts Page . Option 1: The Parent selects the resend option from their portal page. Parents have a link on the login page that says Resend Verification Email? This link will resend the verification email to them. Option 2: The admin sends the parent the verification email from the Parent Portal Accounts Page . Under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Accounts, you can use the Resend Verification Email Link option to resend a parent's verification email. Single-Sign-On Account Creation and Login The Single-Sign option is a very simple experience for parents. Parents can choose the SSO option to create their account or log in to their account. This also means, they can choose to log in via SSO even if they started by manually creating their account . To SSO in, they can either select the Google or Microsoft option, depending on which email server they use. They can also log in manually if they don't want to set up SSO or if they use a different email server from the options we provide. Google SSO Experience The first time they SSO in with Google, they are asked for their email address and password. Hint: it's the email and password they sign into their email account with. After that, when they log in and select the Google SSO option, they'll be able to simply select their email option and be brought into the portal. Microsoft SSO Experience Parents will be asked to enter their Microsoft login credentials (their Microsoft email address) and accept the terms. They have the option to remain logged in, making it a streamlined experience the next time they SSO in. SSO FAQs How can parents reset their passwords? SSO: SSO accounts are connected to a person's email server. If password reset help is needed with SSO, the parent/guardian should be directed to work within their Google or Microsoft account where they will have specific reset options for their email account. Manual: For parents that have manually created an account , there are three ways they can receive a password reset email to help them reset their password: Parent Resets Password with the link on the login page. Admin Resets Password from Contact Record. Admin Resets Password from Parent Portal Accounts Page. Read more here: Parent Portal Account Password Reset Can parents log in manually if they created their account with the SSO option? Nope. Parents who create their account with SSO can't use their email account information to manually log in to the site. The system will not recognize them. If they used SSO when creating their account, they should continue to use SSO to login. Pro Tip: If you are helping troubleshoot login issues, ask them if they logged in with SSO before and have them try that option. Can parents choose SSO after manually creating an account? Yes, parents can choose the SSO option to log in after manually creating an account. Do parents need to create an account before they can utilize the SSO option? No, parents can create an account with either the manual option or the SSO option when they first visit the portal. Is there an internal setup for this? What about the cost? No, this is no internal setup required for SSO to work and there's no additional cost. It will automatically appear as an options for parents in all portals. Do you get a verification email when SSO-ing in? No, the email verification step is only for manual accounts. Everyone logging in or creating an account manually (typing in their email and password) will be required to verify their email account. Parents logging in with SSO are not required to verify their accounts and will not receive the verification email. Can parents request another verification email? Yes, parents have a link on the login page that says Resend Verification Email? This link will resend the verification email to them. Can admins send parents another verification email? Yes, under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Accounts, you can use the Resend Verification Email Link option to resend a parent's verification email. Will the parent portal account merge token still work with SSO accounts that didn't have a manual account prior? Yes! It will still pull the email address into the merge token, even with SSO. Whatever email that the parent uses to sign in with when using SSO will be the one that pulls into the token. Returning to log in Returning parents have the following login options: If they manually created their account, they can sign in with the email + password they created. They can also SSO in with either Google or Microsoft. Reminder Parents logging in or creating accounts manually (typing in their email/password) are required to verify their email address. This is a one-time thing and it's required for all parents. If a parent logs in manually and has not verified their account before, they will receive the verification email and be required to verify their account within 24hrs to maintain access. Email verification is not required for those logging in or creating accounts through SSO. If a parent started by manually creating their account , can they choose to log in with SSO the next time they visit their portal? Yes, if a parent manually creates an account, they can utilize the SSO option when they next log in. In other words, it won't cause any issues for them to select one of the SSO options after they've manually created their account. It will just prompt them to log in with SSO and then take them to their usual portal page with their student information/checklist. If a parent started by using SSO to create their account, can they use the manual log in option the next time they visit the portal? No, a parent that has chosen SSO, can't log in manually with the email/password of their email account. It doesn't work the other way. Parents that choose the SSO option the first time, need to log in using SSO any time they want to access the system after that.

FAQs Setup How do schools sign up? All you need to do is form a group in your area and get in touch to get started. You'll need at least 2 schools to start your group and we'll need to do some backend setup to get you up and rolling. Contact us when you are ready and we'll help you get started. Can a school be added to more than one group? Absolutely! Schools have the flexibility to be included in numerous Explore groups. This means that there is no restriction on the number of groups that a single school can join. Each school can participate in as many groups as necessary, allowing for a diverse range of interactions and collaborations across different educational initiatives. How are gender and ethnicity options pulled in/ decided on? During the initial setup, your group will need to decide on which ethnicity and gender options to include in your Student Information form . Ethnicity Options: You can list whatever options your group agrees on and our team will add them to your form. Gender Options: You can choose from the following options to include: Female, Male, Non-Binary, Self-Identify, Prefer Not To Answer. You can also choose to make these fields optional or remove them from the Student Information form altogether. The field options and setup for these is managed by our team. Please contact your CSM or support to make an adjustment. Can the questions on the Student Information form be edited? The Student Information form can not be edited. However, during the setup, your group will decide on which ethnicity and gender options to include in your Student Information form and those selections can be updated at any time by contacting support. Can you use iframe to embed a school\u2019s website into the parent portal content explore page? This is possible, but we advise against it as it does not make for a clean user experience. Student Info Form and Applications If you are not accepting applications for a grade and you\u2019ve turned the grade off on your Grades page, how does it affect Finalsite Explore process? If a grade is marked as unavailable (collect applications toggled to no), it will still be available in the Student Information form but it will not be available in your application. This means that if parents selects a grade that you\u2019ve toggled off, they\u2019ll be required to select another grade when completing the application. As a best practice, we recommend that you clearly communicate any grades that you are not accepting applications for on your application. What is the Student Information Form? The student information form is an introductory form that parents fill out when they first create an account in Finalsite Explore. Within the introductory form, prospective families enter student, address, and parent information. How does the Student Information form connect to the application form? Whenever a family applies within Finalsite Explore, the information they entered into their Student Information form is automatically populated within their application. Does your application form have to exactly match the student information form? No, your application doesn\u2019t have to exactly match the student information form. Parents will have to complete any additional fields on your application that are not on the Student Information form since only the data collected in the Student Information form will be prepopulated in the application. Reminder: parents only need to submit answers for questions marked as required within a form. Can you still accept Application fees within Finalsite Explore? Yes, your application fee will remain the same. If you are set up to collect an application fee, parents will still be prompted to pay it when completing their application form.

Once selected, the parent is prompted to select their student and click Submit . This action will submit an Inquiry form to the school. The form will only contain the base information collected in Finalsite Explore. (Name, Gender, Apply Grade, Start year, Address, and Parent Info) Check for newly received Inquiries in your Forms Inbox . Enable user notifications and the system will email you when Apps or Inquiries are submitted. When the parent clicks submit, they are directed to whatever website the school has placed in the More Information section of the Explore Content page. The website opens in a new tab. Remember: Inquiries do not have student checklists on the parent end. They'll only go the the parent portal and view the (Admissions) checklist when applying. Options within the Dashboard The Finalsite Explore Dashboard page, lists all students/schools families have applied to. A student's application history will only be listed once the student has applied to a school. View Checklist redirects the Parents to the school's Parent Portal. They will already be logged in and they are brought straight to the Summary page listing their student(s). It's important to keep tabs on your Forms Inbox so that families can start working through the admissions checklist as soon as they'd like. Both the Add Schools and Explore Schools options take you to the Explore Schools page . The Parent Name/Icon menu gives parents the option to visit the My Profile page or Logout. The Help Center link brings families to the dedicated Finalsite Explore Parent Help Center . My Profile page The My Profile page (accessible through the parent name/icon menu in the top right) lists all students, parents, and households added by prospective families. Clicking the plus icon in each section will allow you to add a Student, Parent, or Household, depending on which section you select it in. Each Student, Parent, and Household have two additional options: Edit Information: Opens the existing information for parents to edit. Delete: deletes the student, parent, or household. A pop-up box will ask them to confirm before the action is completed. The Parent Name/Icon menu gives parents the option to visit the Profile page or Logout. Beyond Finalsite Explore When the parent begins the application process with a school, they'll complete checklist items in the school's parent portal. As a best practice, include a link to your school's portal in any system or custom emails the parents receive. That way, the parents can either access their admissions checklist through the link in your email or, through the Dashboard in Finalsite Explore. FAQs How do I test the parent experience? To test out the parent experience in Finalsite Explore, you can either create a test Finalsite Explore account to review the experience from a first-time user perspective or log in with your existing admin credentials. Create a test account by visiting https://portal.fsenrollment.com/. If you are creating a fake test account, you'll need to use a real email address so that you can complete the verification step. Alternatively, you can simply log in with your existing parent portal account (or SSO in) to get an idea of what Finalsite Explore looks like from the parent's perspective. Can I impersonate families in the Finalsite Explore or see their view? No, impersonation is not available in Finalsite Explore. To familiarize yourself with the parent experience, you may wish to create your own test account. Create a test account by visiting https://portal.fsenrollment.com/ . You'll need to use a real email address so that you can complete the verification step. After parents complete the Student Information form, can they update their information? Yes, parents can visit the My Profile page (accessible through the parent name/icon menu in the top right) to edit any student, household, and parent information they completed when filling out the Student Information form. Do parents need a separate email/password for Finalsite Explore and the parent portal? No, Finalsite Explore and the parent portal use the same email and password. Parents can sign in or SSO in (or create an account) in Finalsite Explore and use the same credentials in the parent portal (or vice versa). Do parents need to verify their email address when creating a Finalsite Explore account? Yes, if it\u2019s their first time creating an account manually (typing in a username and password), they must verify their email by clicking the verification link in the email they will receive. Parents are only required to complete the email verification step one time. Parents who utilize the SSO option for account creation will not be required to complete the verification process. Can parents SSO into Finalsite Explore? Yes, parents have the option to SSO into Finalsite Explore through Google or Microsoft.

How this Works If the payment fails due to a supported reason (see the * note in the overview section), the following will occur: Immediately when a payment fails: The charge is added back to the ledger. The Autopay Failure Retry email will be sent to the payer letting them know that the payment failed and that it will be re-attempted. This email also contains the date that the autopay will be re-attempted on. 2 days after that email: The system will attempt the charge again. If it succeeds, autopay stays on and the payer is sent the Payment Received email. If it fails again, autopay is turned off and the Autopay Failure email is sent. Important Notes Payment retries will only happen once. Once the system re-attempts a charge, if this second attempt does not succeed, the payer's autopay will be turned off by the system and they will be sent the Autopay Failure email. NSF Fees are only charged for the first failure. If it fails again, NSF fees will not be charged again. While the system can re-attempt to charge most failed payments, some can not be re-attempted.

In this Article About Permissions Granular Permissions in Email Templates About Granular Permissions in Email Templates Setting Granular Permissions in Email Templates Granular Permissions in Checklist Items About Granular Permissions in Checklist Items Setting Granular Permissions in Checklist Items About Permissions Finalsite Enrollment offers the ability to add permissions to individual accounts. Enabling permissions gives users access to different components of the system. Each permission level designates what the admin/user has access to when they log in. You can read more about the different permission options for accounts in our Admin Portal Accounts: Permission &amp; Access Controls article which contains links to full articles about each separate Permission. Granular Permissions are permissions that you can attach to Email Templates and Checklist items to designate which Admins can/can't interact with them. Real World Example You have a checklist item on your admissions checklist where you allow students to upload their Immunization records. You'd like the student's medical information in these checklist items to be confidential in your site, only accessible by admins with Medical permissions. Setting the checklist item with the Medical Permission option will enable you to do this. Now that you have set Medical Permissions to this checklist item, the data held within the checklist item (which, in this example are immunization records), will only be visible to admins who have Medical Permissions enabled on their account.

    "body": "Overview Shared access allows a parent or billing account holder to grant access to another individual for making one-time payments on an account. Pop some Popcorn! If you'd prefer to watch our video on this, check out the following videos: Shared Access Setup Shared Access: Parent Experience Also, we have a video in the parent help center that was designed specifically for parents: How to set up shared payment access In this article Important Notes Parent/Guardian Process for Granting a Contact Shared Billing Access Experience of a Shared Billing Access Contact Billing Communications for Shared Access FAQs Important Notes Shared accounts can only make one-time payments, as Autopay is only available to primary billing accounts. Only the following relationship types can be granted ledger access: Parent, Guardian, Consultant, Mother, Father, Stepmother, Stepfather. If a parent would like to add a shared contact but doesn't see their name, it's because they are not connected to the student as a related contact in Finalsite Enrollment. You can add the new person as a related contact on the student and then the parent will see them in the shared access dropdown. Parent/Guardian Process for Granting a Contact Shared Billing Access Parents/Guardians can add a contact for shared billing access within their Parent Portal &gt; Billing Management tab. On the right side of their page, parents will see a section titled Manage Share Billing Access . To add a contact, they will select the Add Additional Contact button. Once they click the button a dropdown opens, allowing them to select a contact. When they have selected a contact from the dropdown, they will be able to select the \"check\" button to confirm the addition. The shared account will receive an email (so long as there's one on file within the system) with instructions and a link to access the account. Experience of a Shared Billing Access Contact Shared accounts can log into the Parent Portal and click on the Billing Management tab at the top. If the shared access contact only has access to one contact, when they select the Billing Management tab, they will see the parent/guardian's ledger that added them as a shared contact and they will have access to the Make a Payment button. Example Scenario: Rosalind's grandmother would like to occasionally help with her tuition payments. Rosalind's mother, Agatha, adds the grandmother (Bernice) to Shared Billing Access. When Bernice logs in and navigates to the billing management tab, she'll see a view of Agatha's ledger and the Make a Payment button. Bernice can use that to make one-time payments on behalf of her granddaughter. If the shared access contact has been granted access to more than one account or they have their own ledger in addition to one shared with them. They will see a Select Account dropdown above the ledger. This will allow them to switch to whichever account, they'd like to make a payment on. Billing Communications for Shared Access IMPORTANT: If a parent adds a contact for Shared Access, they will not be automatically set up to receive automatic billing communications. These must be enabled by the admin. How to enable Auto Billing Communication for parents with shared access On the student's record, select the Billing Tab. Within the Shared Access box, toggle on communications within the ' Notifications ' column Toggling it on auto-saves the selection and locks it in place. FAQs Can a shared account sign up for Autopay? At this time, a shared account cannot sign up for Autopay. Although the Autopay option displays, it will not be saved for a shared account. Can a shared account view the primary billing account\u2019s payment information? No, a shared account cannot view or edit a primary billing account\u2019s payment information. They can make one-time payments by entering their payment details. How can a shared account make a payment? Shared accounts can only make one-time payments, as Autopay is only available to primary billing accounts. Shared accounts can click on the ' Billing Management' tab along the top and then click on the \u2018Make Payment\u2019 button. The shared account will be asked to enter the payment amount, and then they\u2019ll enter either their credit card information or electronic check details. Please note, that a shared account will not be enrolled in Autopay. How do I remove/revoke access to billing management from a shared account? If you\u2019d like to remove or revoke access to the billing management tab for a shared account, click on the red \u2018 x \u2019 next to the contact's name within the ' Billing ' tab of the student's record. Please note, that parents can also remove/revoke access to shared accounts within the Parent Portal. A confirmation message will display. Click on the \u2018 delete contact \u2019 button to complete this action. The shared account will no longer have access to the billing management tab unless you decide to reassign them at a later point in time.

    "body": "Overview Important This is only available to those who have CMS and have Finalsite Leadflow enabled in their EMS and CMS sites. If you have CMS and would like to enable this, please contact support . You can read more about this here, in the article: Finalsite Leadflow . The Leads Report is a built-in report under Search &amp; Reports &gt; Admissions Reports &gt; Leads. Understanding the Leads Report This report shows each Lead Source*, the number of Leads, and the number of students generated from the lead form (including any added siblings), separated by workflow. It can be valuable for monitoring the performance of your CMS forms, such as tracking the number of applicants or enrolled students it's generated. Additionally, it can help you assess the effectiveness of your nurture campaign linked to these forms. *The Lead Source is the name of the form in CMS. Date Range Filter Use the Date Range filter to filter the report by one of the pre-built options or, use Custom to create your own custom date range. Columns Within the Report: Leads Source: The CMS form name. Lead: The number of parents created by the form. Prospect through Enrollment: The number of students tied to that lead in any of those statuses including any siblings added to the initial student. As a student progresses in the workflow, the report will update to move them into whatever new workflow they have progressed to. Example Take a look at CMS form Lead Gen - Parent and Student . Here is a breakdown of the data from that form: 8 Leads (parents records with at least a name and email) The following students were brought in with those leads: 6 Prospects 1 student that is now an Applicant 1 student that is now in the Enrollment workflow If one of the 6 Prospects were to become an Applicant, the report would automatically update to reflect that, showing 5 Prospects and 2 Applicants.

    "body": "Overview Leads generated from a composer form on your school's website (CMS) can be converted into leads on the EMS side. Important: Grades and Terms The format of your terms and grades must exactly match in CMS and EMS in order for the Leadflow form to work. For example, if the grade choice in EMS is listed as \"1st\" , you must use \"1st\" and not \"first\" as a field choice in the CMS form. Don't alter the terms or grades within your EMS site to match the values on the form. Instead, alter the CMS form to match the values in your EMS site. This helps avoid potential problems, as alterations to term or grade formats can impact various aspects of your EMS site. You can check your EMS grades page under Settings &gt; General &gt; Grades and your terms page under Settings &gt; General &gt; Terms . Getting Notified: When setting up your form on the CMS end, be sure to toggle on Send to Admin, that way, if there is an issue with your mapping, you'll be notified of it when a form comes through. In this article Important: Grades and Terms How to Enable this Feature Leads in CMS Create a Form Set form notifications Configure Form Settings Leads in EMS Workflow Where the Parent/Student can be found in EMS once they are created Leads Status Lead Role Lead Source and Lead Source Date How to Enable This Feature If you're interested in enabling this feature, please contact our Support team for the initial setup. Leads in CMS After the internal setup process has been completed, you can now create and configure a form in CMS module menu &gt; Forms . Once completed, creates a \u201clead\u201d that can be connected between the CMS and EMS. Create a form Open up Forms from the module menu. Build a form with easily customizable fields that can solicit the information you need to bring a person into your system. At a minimum, the connector form must include the following fields: Parent Name Parent Email Additional fields that can be included and tracked are: Entry Grade (optional) Child Name (optional) Entry Year Name (optional) Set form notifications After adding your form fields, customize your form Submit options in the quick panel in the right column. Set Notification emails in the CMS Forms module so that the right people can stay looped in as soon as a form is submitted. Configure form settings Once your form build is complete and notifications set up, configure the Integration Settings which can be found by clicking on the Settings tab in a selected form. Once in Settings, scroll past General and Payment settings to find the Integration Settings box. Toggle on Enable Finalsite Enrollment and match the Enrollment lead title with any CMS form labels used in this particular form. Once settings are configured, Display or share your form so that anyone completing and submitting this form may then be connected to Finalsite Enrollment. Leads in EMS Workflow Once you've enabled this feature and set one of your forms in Composer to map data into Finalsite Enrollment, whenever that form is completed, some of the data within the form will be transferred to Finalsite Enrollment (EMS) where it will automatically create parent and (if possible)* student records. *Note: The data sent over is determined by what you have enabled in the CMS form setup. What information can be passed over? Parent Name (required) Parent Email (required) Student Name (optional) Student Email (optional) That info is used in EMS to automatically create parent and (if possible) student records. If only parent data is enabled for sharing, only a parent record is created in EMS. The parent is created with the role of Lead. If parent and student data is enabled for sharing, both parent and student records are created in EMS. The parent is created with the role of Lead and the student as a Prospect . Where the Parent/Student can be found in EMS once they are created Students/Parents created this way are trackable within the following places on your site: Leads Workflow Page: (Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Leads) This tab will list all parents who have been created through a Leadflow Form. Leads Report: (Search &amp; Reports &gt; Admissions Reports &gt; Leads Report) This report shows each Lead Source (CMS form name) and the number of students generated from it, separated by status. Columns Within the Report: Leads Source: The CMS form name. Lead: The number of parents created by the form. Prospect through Enrollment: The number of students tied to that lead in any of those statuses including any siblings added to the initial student. Prospects Page: (Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Prospects) This tab lists all prospects (including the students who are created through a Leadflow Form). Dashboard: Within the Dashboard of your site, you can filter your funnel by Lead Source (CMS form name). Note: The Funnel only displays data for students who have progressed into the workflow, i.e. it doesn't show your prospects, only inquiry and onwards. Important: Keep in Mind Communication plans are not available for leads and prospects at this time. Communication must be manual until a student enters the 'Inquiry' Phase. Lead Status The Lead Status is one of the columns you'll see on the Leads Workflow page (Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Leads). This is the status given to your Leads allowing you to track them. There are three statuses for Leads. Active: Once a form is submitted and the record is created in EMS, the Lead (parent) will have an Active status. If a student is sent at the same time, the Lead will automatically show as Progressed rather than Active. Progressed: The Lead will have the status of Progressed whenever a student is added to them (or if they are imported with a student). Inactive: If you'd like to mark a lead or group of leads as inactive, you can do so manually within their record by editing the Lead Status field under the Personal Tab. You can also update their status to inactive in bulk on the leads list page by using edit &gt; update a field. See the box below for the detailed steps on how to change this status individually or in bulk. Can I manually update the Lead status? Yep! You may wish to mark some leads as inactive if you haven't heard back from them in a while. Expand each dropdown to learn how. Update the Lead Status in Bulk From the Leads page, select one or more of the Leads. From the Edit menu, select Update a Field . Search for Lead Status. Select the new status from the dropdown menu. Select Next . Select Update to confirm and submit the update. Update a Lead Status on a Record Navigate to the Lead (parent) record by searching for their name or clicking on their name on the Leads Workflow page. On their record, select the Personal Tab. Select Edit Fields . Update the status to Inactive in the dropdown for the Lead Status field. Select Save Edits . Lead Role The role of Lead is an out-of-workflow role that is assigned to parents or guardians who are added to EMS through a Leadflow form. The role is automatically applied to any parent that is brought in through a Leadflow form. Parents/Guardians with the role of Lead will appear in the Leads workflow list under Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Leads. If the role of Lead is removed from a parent/guardian they will no longer appear in the Leads Workflow list. To learn more about roles and statuses, please check out this article: Roles &amp; Statuses Explained Can I add or remove the role of Lead from a parent? Yep! Here's how to do that: Navigate to the Lead (parent) record by searching for their name or clicking on their name on the Leads Workflow page. Select Edit. Select Change Role. Select or De-select Lead. Select Save Changes . You'll see a green confirmation box letting you know that the role was changed successfully. What's the difference between a Lead and a Prospect? Leads and Parents are both considered Roles in Finalsite Enrollment. A role defines the type of contact in the system. For example, the role of \"Parent\" identifies anyone in the system who is a parent. The main difference between a Lead and a Prospect is that a Lead is a Parent while a Prospect is a Student. Leads represent parents that have been added to Finasite Enrollment through a Leadflow Form. Prospects can be students brought over from a Leadflow form, but they can also be imported into your site or added through the Quick Action menu. Lead Source and Lead Source Date The Lead Source is the name of the CMS form submitted by the lead (parent). You can see this data on the Leads Workflow page (Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Leads) and the Leads Report (Search &amp; Reports &gt; Admissions Reports &gt; Leads.) The Lead Source Date column displays the date that a lead comes in from CMS. You can see this data on the Leads Workflow page (Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Leads.) Good to know: If a duplicate lead comes in and is merged, the oldest (original) submission date will show.

In Finalsite Enrollment, \"fields\" are like containers for storing specific information about students, parents, and contacts. To learn more specifics about how Fields function in Finalsite Enrollment, check out the Fields Overview article. To learn more about the types of Fields in Finalsite Enrollment, refer to the Field Types article. To learn about field settings options, review the Field Settings article.

Admin Account Types: System Admin &amp; Admin Permissions: Data In this article Read This First Create a New Field Field Details Edit an Existing Field Field Edit Workflows Changing Previous Field Values to Match New Values Updating Field Values that are Used in Exports Read This First Editing fields can affect different parts of your site and data. Because of this, our team has created a list of things to keep in mind. Before diving into creating or editing fields, we recommend you read this section first. A quick note about the term Field Values: We use the term field values often throughout this article. When doing so, we are referring to the options in a field. For example, \"yes\" or \"no\". Whatever options you input within the field's options box are known as the \"field values.\" Searching: If you edit or delete a field value, the original value will no longer appear in your search results and you will not be able to search on it. Because of this, we urge you to use caution when making edits or removing values. But what if you need to update a field value and would like to change the previous values to match the updated version? We've got you covered! Click here to check out our helpful guide below which gives you step-by-step instructions for navigating that. Spelling: On a similar note, when you are adding or editing fields, it's always a good idea to double-check and triple-check the spelling. Forms: If you go to edit a field that is listed on a form, we've built in a warning message that looks something like the one below. That way, you can double-check and adjust the form if needed. If you edit a value used as a dependency on a form, you need to re-add that value to the form options. If you delete a field value that's used as a dependency on a form, the value will no longer appear to those completing the form. Exports: If you select to edit a field that is used within an export, you will see a warning message like the one below. It's important to use caution when considering adjustments to the values of those fields and we recommend contacting support for help with this. Click here to jump to our notes on what to do when you need to adjust a field that's used on an export. Checklist Items, Contract Fees, and Payment Plans: If you select to edit a field that's used to add a rule to a checklist item, contract fee, or payment plan, you will see one of the messages below. If you see this message, please reach out to our support team with the details of what you'd like to adjust within the field and we'll be happy to help you navigate that. Checklist Item Rule Message Contract Fee Rule Message Payment Plan Rule Message Create a New Field Navigate to the Fields page: Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields . Select the Add a New Field link. Complete the Field Details Options. (Read the guide below in the Field Details section to learn about each option). Once you've reviewed your field and are ready, select Submit to finalize and save your new field. If you do not wish to continue, simply \"x\" out the box, or select Close . Field Details Ctype: This is the type of field you are creating. For a quick reference, check out our Field Type Quick Guide below to review the most common field types. You can also refer to the Field Types article for more detailed insight into the options. Display Name: This is the name of the field. The name should be short, yet clear enough for someone to read it and know the purpose of the field. Here are our recommendations for creating a good display name: Keep it simple but descriptive: think in keywords instead of full sentences. Check your spelling :) Canonical Name: This is the system name for the field. It will populate automatically for you but you can edit it manually when creating the field. Once you save the field, it is locked in and cannot be adjusted. Suffix: This is part of the internal, system name for the field. The system will input this automatically. Grouping: Use the dropdown to select the group the field should belong to. To learn more about field groups, please refer to the Field Settings article. Searchable: Selecting this option makes the field searchable. If you'd like to be able to pull the data within this field into a search, select this box. Term Based: USE CAUTION Selecting this option makes the field term-based. Term-based fields clear out each year when you roll students over to the next term. Term based fields may only be mapped to the student as parents and other entities do not have a term. Once a field is set as term based, it can not be undone. To review more about term-based fields, please refer to this article: Term-Based Fields &amp; Enrollment Refresh. Hide From Form: If you select \"Hide From Form\" for a field used in a form, its value will be hidden when admins are viewing the form. Regardless of the admin permission level, any admin who views forms on the record, downloads the PDF version of a form, or checks out a form in the review module will see \"Hidden From View\" instead of the data for any field that has \"Hide From Form\" enabled. Check out this section in our Field Settings article for more insight. Options: Use the options box for Boolean (yes or no), Boolean List Fields (multi-select), and Single Select (dropdown) fields. Leave this blank for any other type of field you create. For a quick reference, check out our Field Type Quick Guide below. Internal Description: This is optional. If you add an internal description, it will display on the Fields page within the description column when hovering over the icon. Contact Layout: Selecting these options tells the system when you want to display the field. For example, if you only need to see this field on your Applicant's records, then you would select only Applicant from this list. Field Type Quick Guide This is a quick reference describing only the most common field types. For a full list and description of all field types, please check out our Field Types article. Text: Smaller open text box that can hold any type of information. Text Fields do not have set character or word limits. Do not enter anything in the Description box when creating or editing a text field. Example of a text field: Text Area Field: Larger open text box that can hold any type of information. It preserves line breaks and will always display submitted data across the full width of the page to make it easier to read long answers. Ideal for essays, internal notes, and any other items requiring longer responses. TextArea Fields do not have set character or word limits. Do not enter anything in the Description box when creating or editing a text field. Example of a Text Area Field: Single Select: Drop-down list field in which only one selection can be made from the list of options. Useful for collecting data such as t-shirt size, so that a single value can be selected from a list of options. When creating a Single Select Field, you must enter the field options in the Description box. Example of a Single Select Field: Boolean: Field in which accepted values are only yes or no . Additional options cannot be added to Boolean Fields. When creating a Boolean Field, you must enter yes and no as the options within the Description box. Example of a Boolean Field: Boolean List Field: Multi-select field in which one or more of the listed options can be selected. Useful for collecting data such as academic or athletic interests, so that a student can check all that apply. When creating a Boolean List Field, you must enter the list options within the Description box. Example of a Boolean List Field: Edit an Existing Field Please Read Before you make any Field Edits Before you make any field edits, please be sure you've reviewed the Read This First section at the top and the Field Edit Workflows below. Navigate to the Fields page: Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields. Select the Edit link on the right side of the page and the Field Details pop-up will open. Once your edits are complete, select Submit to save the changes. If you do not wish to make a change, simply \"x\" out the box, or select Close . Field Edit Workflows Changing Previous Field Values to Match New Values Sometimes you need to change a field value and want the previous value updated to match the new one. Updating the previous value can clean up your data and keep things consistent. The following steps using a real-world example can guide you through our recommended approach. Real World Example: You plan to change one of your ethnicity values from Asian American to Asian and would like all prior existing values changed. Here's what you do: Add the new value (Asian) to the field option list. Run a search under the current term to pull all contacts with the prior value (ethnicity = Asian American). Select all contacts ( *remember: If the search is multiple pages long this must be done by page and you should start with the last page of the search). From the Edit menu select Update a Field Value. Update all student's field values to the new option. Go back to the Field's page (Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields). Select to edit the Ethnicity field. Remove the old value (Asian American). Updating Field Values that are Used in Exports Changing a field value that's on an export can affect your mapping and break your export. If you need to make a change that affects the values listed on one of your exports, here's what we recommend wrapped in a real-world example. Real-World Example: You have the ethnicity field in an export. In EMS, the value in your ethnicity field is Asian and, in your other SIS, you need that value to simply be A . Here's what to do: Contact Support . Let the support team know: Which field you edited What change you've made to the field What Export the field lives on The Support team will take it from there!

    "body": "Overview The Billing Dashboard, located within the Billing menu, presents a comprehensive overview of your billing data, making it easy for you to track and monitor your school's overall billing health at a glance. The Dashboard is divided into two sections: Historical Percentages of Overdue Charged vs Collected Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: System Admins, Admins, and Users Permissions: Financial In this article Location Historical Percentages of Overdue Charged vs Collected Location The Billing Dashboard is located within the Billing menu. Important Notes Due to the large amount of data within this dashboard, it is anticipated that you may encounter slow loading times for the page. Currently, accounts never become inactive within the system which means that the data within this report displays for both active and inactive accounts. However, a new feature will soon be launched to address this. Once this feature is implemented, the reporting logic in this report will be adjusted to only calculate data from active accounts. Historical Percentages of Overdue This top section of the Billing Dashboard displays your school's overdue percentage by month within a graph. The Historical Percentages of Overdue graph displays 3 years of data which includes the current year and the past two years. Each year is represented with a unique color line. It exclusively presents historical data. For the current term, the line extends up to the previous month. Note the light blue line in the image below representing 2023. It was August 2023 at the time the snapshot was created, therefore, the 2023 line ends at July. Past due flags are set nightly. If an account becomes past due it may not be reflected until the next day. Amounts are updated every 10 minutes Filtering and Hover Options Overdue By filter: Positioned above the graph, you have the option to filter based on the duration for which the amounts have been overdue: 0-30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, 91+ days, or Total (to display all overdue amounts, irrespective of the duration). Links to the AR Aging Report: Each bullet point within the graph links to the matching AR Aging report filtered by that month. Click on the icon point to navigate to the matching AR Aging report. Please note that you may also experience a slow load time while the AR Aging report calculates your selected filter. Data while Hovering: When you place your cursor over any of the months along the line, the graph will reveal the total overdue amounts for that specific month. Filter by Year: Within the graph, you have the ability to filter and display only selected terms. Choose one of the terms listed below the graph to exclude that specific dataset. Charged vs Collected The lower section of the Billing Dashboard features a bar graph illustrating the monthly comparison between your school's total charges and your total collected amounts. Both this bar graph and the pie charts below update with any new data every 10 minutes. Charged vs Collected Defined Charged: calculated by the total amount charged minus the total amount credited. Collected: the total amount of all payments. Filtering/Hover Options Start Month and End Month: Located above the graph, you have the option to apply filters to the data by selecting a start month and an end month. Data while Hovering: When you place your cursor over the bars within the graph, the graph will reveal the total amounts collected and charged for that month. Filter by Charged or Collected: You can filter the graph to display either only the data bars for Collected payments or exclusively for Charged payments. Select either Charged or Collected below the graph to exclude that data from the display. Payment Success and Payment Type Beneath that chart, you'll find two pie charts that provide supplementary information: Payment Success: Showing the amount of successful payments compared to the amount of failed payments. Payment Type: Provides a breakdown of all payment types utilized on your site. Data while Hovering: Place your cursor over each segment within the charts to reveal the total dollar amount associated with each category.

This article includes details for both Billing and Non-Billing schools on managing students who withdrew. In this article Managing a Midyear Withdrawal Student Billing: Ledger Management for Students who Withdrew Managing a Midyear Withdrawal Student Update the Students Status When dealing with a student who has withdrawn, you'll first want to update their status to Mid Year Withdrawal . Here's how: Access the student's contact record and click on the Edit button. Hover over Change Status for XXXX-XXXX Hover over Enrolled Select Mid Year Withdrawal A pop-up box will ask you to confirm whether or not you want to proceed with the status update. Click Save to confirm. What Updating the Status Does and What the Parents See This updates the student's status and assigns them the Former Student role, which means that the student is now considered Out of Workflow . The student will no longer be counted in your Dashboard Funnel or Current Counts. You can read more about Roles and Statuses within our Roles and Statuses Explained article. What the Parent sees when they log in: Parents/Guardians will no longer see the student in the portal and the student's checklist will no longer be available to them when they log in. Note for Billing Schools It is important to note that changing the status will not waive the contracted tuition amount or affect the ledger in any way. You can read more about managing this in the next section of this article. Billing: Ledger Management for Students who Withdrew Pop some Popcorn! If you'd like to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library. As noted above, updating a student's status to Mid Year Withdrawal does not affect the ledger in any way. If the parent will be responsible for the remaining charges within their ledger, no action is necessary. However, if you'd like to forgive the balance of the parent/guardian, you will need to make adjustments to their ledger. There are three ways to approach this, each is outlined below. Important When forgiving balances with one of the methods below, please consider the following note: When forgiving the remaining balance of a parent, it should ideally be at zero, not in the negative (aka credit balance). If the parent has a balance or credit balance, they\u2019ll still receive billing communications. To accomplish this, it's vital for each upcoming month to have a zero balance. See this example image below. Each month in the parent's remaining financial obligations has a zero balance. This is what you want. Option 1 Option 2 Option 3 Reverse Charge Use the Reverse Charge button within the ledger to reverse outstanding contract charges. Then, you can use the trashcan icon to delete any outstanding manually added items. Step 1: Reverse the Contract Charges Use the reverse button on the right side of each contract fee to reverse the charge. Refer to the Reverse Charge section of the Billing: Add Charge article for step-by-step details or practice below with the interactive tutorial. 8 STEPS 1. From the parent's billing ledger, select the reverse icon next to a charge. 2. The system will automatically create the charge reversal. Select Preview at the bottom to continue. 3. On the preview screen, select the arrow icon to expand the line items. 4. Preview the adjustment and then click Confirm to post the reversal to the ledger. 5. You can expand the Reversal and Tuition line items to review the reversal on the ledger. Click the icon to expand the Reversal line item. 6. Click the icon to expand the Tuition line item. 7. Review the Tuition and Reversal line items on the ledger. 8. Great Work! Reversing line items allows you to easily forgive the balance of a student who withdraws from the school. Repeat this process for every contract line item on the ledger. Here's an interactive tutorial ** Best experienced in Full Screen (click the icon in the top right corner before you begin) ** https://www.iorad.com/player/2388576/How-to-Reverse-Contract-Line-Items Step 2: Remove manually added Charges Because the reverse button is only available for use with charges that came from the contract, you'll also need to manually adjust any remaining charges in order to bring the account to a zero balance. To accomplish this, you can use the red trashcan icon to delete the remaining outstanding charges. A few notes: Use caution when deleting items. Take care to ensure that you are only deleting outstanding charges. The goal is to bring the account to a zero balance, so, you can leave charges that already have matching payments as is. If you delete an item by mistake, you can restore it on the Audit tab. Please review our Billing: How To Restore a Deleted Ledger Item for more insight or try it for yourself in the interactive tutorial below. 3 STEPS 1. On the parent's billing ledger, click the red trashcan icon next to the charge you'd like to delete. 2. Click Delete in the conformation box to confirm. This is your final step. Once you click delete the item will be deleted. 3. You're done! Use caution when deleting ledger items. Take care to ensure that you are not deleting charges that have already been paid. Here's an interactive tutorial ** Best experienced in Full Screen (click the icon in the top right corner before you begin) ** https://www.iorad.com/player/2388600/Deleting-manually-added-ledger-items- Rearrange Installments + Reverse Charges Step 1 Use the Rearrange Installments button to combine the remaining charges into the smallest number of payments allowed. 9 STEPS 1. From the parent's Billing Ledger, click Rearrange Installments. 2. Confirm that you have the correct contact and term within the Billing Contact dropdown. 3. Click to open the Number of Payments dropdown menu. 4. Select the lowest number of payments allowed. 5. Click Save to submit the rearrangement. 6. Review the rearranged ledger. 7. You did it!

Refer to the Billing: Add Charge article for step-by-step details on how to use the Reverse Charge button. Zero out Contact This option is built into the Add Charge and Add Credit ledger buttons. When selected it zeros out the entire balance of the contact. Important This option is not recommended unless you have an equal distribution of expenses across all months or if you are able to Rearrange the Installments of the contract into one lump charge as mentioned in Option 2. The effectiveness of this option relies on the parent owing the exact same amount for each month. If the amounts owed vary, the system will be unable to evenly divide the total, resulting in the parent receiving billing communications implying they still have outstanding payments. If the parent does not owe the exact same every month (or you were not able to lump the charge into one installment, it is not recommended to choose this option. If you aren't sure, go through the steps to Zero Out the Contact and, on the preview page, if the amounts divided are not exactly matching the charges of each month on the ledger, then choose one of the other options. Expand this box to learn how to Zero Out a Contact. Zero out Contact This option zeros out the remaining balance of an account ledger. You'll see the Zero out Contact option in both the Add Charge and Add Credit options. It functions the same regardless of which option you use to apply this. Selecting Zero Out Contact adds a negative charge for the amount outstanding in order to bring the amount owed to $0. Once you have set a Description and selected Zero Out Contact for the Distribution, you will complete the following options. Contact: Select the contact/term you'd like to zero out. Posting Options: When zeroing out a contact, we recommend choosing the Evenly Across Months option. Keep the Start month set as the current month and set the Number of Months to the number of months remaining on the family's ledger. Select Preview to review. Select Previous to go back and make changes. Select Edit Splits if you need to make any changes to the breakdown. Select Confirm to approve the reversal and add it to the ledger. Remember, if you zero out the contact and you see a balance owed each month you should delete the withdrawal items from the ledger and go with one of the other options. Even though the family is at a zero balance, they will continue to receive communications if their ledger shows an amount owed each month. Try this out with an interactive tutorial below 13 STEPS 1. From the parent's ledger, click Add Charge 2. Enter a Description. This is visible on the ledger. 3. Select Zero out contact 4. Select the student and term from the Contact dropdown. 5. Click Evenly across months 6. Check the the Start Year is correct. 7. Check that the Start Month is correct. 8. In the Number of Months dropdown, select the length of the payment plan. In this example, we'll select 4. 9. Select 4 10. Click Preview to check the distribution. 11. Click Confirm 12. Check the ledger to confirm that the end balance is $0.0. 13. Well done! You've successfully zeroed out the contact. Remember, this option is only successful if the family owes the exact same amount each month.

Why is Finalsite Enrollment child-centric? Workflow Definitions Parents in the System Other Related Contacts Consultants Siblings Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, etc Household and Household Assignments What does Child-Centric mean? Child-Centric means that information is pulled based on the student and all their contacts are associated or tied to the student record. Finalsite Enrollment is child-centric vs other programs like FACTS, Blackbaud, and Powserschool which are all family-centric and start at the level of the parent or the household. Why is Finalsite Enrollment Child Centric? We are child-centric because Admissions and Enrollment is a child or student-centric process. Finalsite Enrollment starts with the student's record and all other records are associated with the student. For example, when creating a search, you will always start with the child, and then, if you want to show related contacts such as siblings, parents, and consultants, you can add them as additional columns within the search. Workflow Definitions Contacts in Finalsite Enrollment have two states: In-Workflow and Out-of-Workflow . In-Workflow is anyone that is working their way through the Admissions Funnel. This includes all statuses that you can see on the dashboard from Inquiry up to enrolled on any given year. Out-of-workflow is all contacts that are not working their way through the Admissions Funnel. This includes roles such as prospects, parents, siblings (that aren't applying, enrolling, or enrolled), consultants, former students, and alumni. Learn More For more info on Roles and Statues for In-Workflow and Out-of-Workflow contacts in the system, please refer to our article: Roles and Statuses Explained . Learn more about the Dashboard and Funnel in our: Dashboard Funnel &amp; Current Counts article. Parents in the System Parents are defined as legal guardians in the system and they are numbered according to how they were entered on whichever form a student first submits (typically, the inquiry or application form). Other Related Contacts Consultants Consultants are tied to any number of students. they do not live in a household and do not have a numbering system. They can authenticate to a student's checklist and create a parent portal account. Read more about Consultants in this article: Consultant &amp; Agent Management . Siblings Siblings are considered a Relationship Type in the system rather than a role or a status. This is why you can not search for siblings on the site. You can, however, export sibling data. If you don't already have one, our team can quickly add a sibling export for you. Please reach out to our Support Team if you have further questions regarding this. Grandparents, Aunts, Uncles, etc These relatives are connected to the student's record and have their own records as well, however, because they are not considered parents or guardians, they do not have access to the student's checklist in the parent portal. If you need one of these relatives to have portal access (the ability to view and manage a student's checklist) you will need to change their relationship to Guardian. Learn how within this article: Contact Record: Related Contacts . Household and Household Assignments Households are family units, they are comprised of the address, student, parents, and other relatives that reside within it. Parents 1 and 2 reside in Household 1 Parents 3 and 4 reside in Household 2 The Primary Parent (or Parent 1) must always be set at living in Household 1.

If you'd prefer to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library. How Payments Are Added to this Report Manually added payments are payments added by: Completing a fee checklist item manually (like marking a deposit fee as complete). Using the Add Payment button on the ledger to add a payment to a ledger. Regardless of the payment method selected (Electronic Check, Credit Card, Cash, etc.) any payment that is manually added to the ledger through the above methods will show up in this report. Additional Notes When manually checking off a fee checklist item (like a Deposit checklist item), the received date is optional. If none is added, the In-School Payments report will display the date the item was marked as complete. For ledger corrections that require adding a manual payment (such as adjusting a lump sum payment), we recommend adding a description that allows you to easily spot these within this report. Within the Report Within the In-School Payments report, you can: Filter the results based on the date a payment was recorded as received within the Received Date Range dropdown. Use the Filter Options dropdown, to filter the report in a variety of ways. Export the report as a CSV or PDF. The following columns are displayed with the results: Posted Date Student Name Term Associated Account Amount Description Category Type Payment Method Received Date Each line item can be expanded to display the student name, term, and billing category.

    "body": "Overview The Projected Income Report displays your expected income by billing date. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: System Admins and Admins Permissions: Financial In this article Report Overview and Options Setting Parameters and Filtering the Report Exporting Additional Insights Pop some Popcorn! If you'd like to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library. Report Overview and Options Where to find the report: Billing menu &gt; Projected Income Report This report displays a projection of your expected income by billing date. The following categories are listed for each billing date: Autopay: The account has autopay turned on. These accounts are expected to pay on time on their billing date and the projected amounts here should be accurate to what you will receive. Manual: The account is current but does not have autopay turned on. The account holders will pay manually in the parent portal billing tab or by submitting cash or a paper check. These accounts are at higher risk of missing their payments because they are not utilizing Auto-pay. Overdue: These accounts are currently overdue. The system assumes that the account will stay overdue until they become current, therefore, any charge added to overdue accounts will increase the amount in the Overdue column. If the account remains overdue for more than a month, the amount owed will shift to the next month's Overdue column. The system will continue moving unpaid accounts in the overdue column until the account becomes current. Example: One parent account is overdue $50 in June. A $100 charge is added. The overdue column updates overnight to reflect that the account is now $150 overdue. The account does not get paid up and remains overdue in July. The June column is now $0 and the overdue amount ($150) is now listed in July's overdue row because it's now projected to be paid in July. Setting Parameters and Filtering the Report You can set an end month and term for the report at the top of the page. You can filter the report by term or grade within the Filter Options dropdown. Exporting The report can be exported to a CSV or PDF through the Export menu. Additional Insights Some Billing features update in reports overnight, meaning you will see some changes the next day. For example, if a parent enables Autopay, that will be reflected in this report the following day. The same will happen if an account goes from overdue to current or vice versa. The report only shows amounts for future dates. After a billing date has passed, the report will show 0 in that column. Example: The report is based on the billing date (the date the payment is collected/due). Charges added after that month's billing date has passed will be reflected on the next month's projections. Example: 5th of the Month: Parent's Billing Date June 9th: a charge for that parent is added to the ledger. The amount will be projected to be collected on July 5th within the report.

    "body": "Overview The Auto-Waitlist feature can be enabled through the Grades page. When it's turned on for a grade, if a student applies to that grade, they will automatically be added to the waitlist. In this article How it Works Waitlist Status Waitlists Page Ideas for Improving the Waitlist Experience Automated Communications for Waitlisted How it Works The auto-waitlist feature can be turned on and off for each grade within the Grades page on your site under Settings &gt; General &gt; Grades . This will automatically put any student that applies for that grade on the waitlist page and update their status to Waitlisted. Waitlist Status The waitlist status is only visible on the Admin end. Parents still see the checklist and the \"Applying for X Grade in [Term]\" message and still have access to the student's checklist. Admin Side: Parent Side: Waitlists Page The Waitlist page (Admissions &gt; Waitlists) is where you can view and manage your waitlisted students. To view a waitlist, select a term and a grade. Students can be dragged and dropped to change their position on the waitlist. Selecting one or more students in a waitlist opens the Download, Communicate, and Edit menus allowing for management options. Other Ways Students get added to the Waitlist Page Apart from parents/guardians submitting an Application for a grade that has been waitlisted, there are two other ways students will populate on the Waitlists page. Admin Entered Applications: If you internally submit an application for a student in a grade set to Auto-Waitlist, the student will automatically be added to the waitlists page. Manual Status Update: If you manually update a student's status to Waitlisted, they will also appear on the Waitlists page. Lottery: If your school utilizes the lottery feature, students who are not accepted when a lottery is run will be auto-waitlisted. Ideas for Improving the Waitlist Experience You may wish to consider the following when setting up grades to Auto-Waitlist students. If you have questions on how to implement any of the below options, please connect with our support team. Application form: On the application you may wish to add language that will show if a waitlisted grade has been selected. Important: you must remember to remove this from the application once the grade is no longer waitlisted. Application fee: Families that apply to waitlist grades still need to pay the application fee. Consider adding a rule to the Application Fee that will set the app fee to $0 for waitlisted grades. Our Support team will need to add this rule for you. Important: You must remember to deactivate this application fee rule once the grade is no longer set to auto-waitlist. Communicating: All applications submitted typically trigger the Application Thank You email. If you are auto-waitlisting grades you might consider setting up an alternate workflow to support communications with your waitlisted families. See the steps on setting this up in the Automated Communications for Waitlisted section below. Automated Communications for Waitlisted Steps to create an alternate workflow for automated communication for waitlisted families. At a Glance Disable the automatic Application Thank You email. Build an Automated Communication Plan for non-waitlisted students. Build an Automated Communication Plan for waitlisted students. Please note: This is only available to schools that have a Pro account with us. Deactivate the automated Application Thank You system email: Uncheck it and Save the setting under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Setup . Create a custom Application Thank You Email: On the System Emails page , copy the Application Thank You Email contents. Navigate to your Custom Emails page (Settings &gt; Communication&gt; Email Templates &gt; Custom Emails) and paste the email into a new template. Save this email template with a recognizable name. You are going to use it to create an Automated Communication Plan email for non-waitlisted families. Create a custom Waitlist Thank You Email : Create a new email template. In this template, craft an email to send to your waitlisted families. Save the template with a recognizable name so that it can be easily found and added to an Automated Communication Plan for your waitlisted families. Set Up an Automated Communication Plan for your Non-Waitlisted Families: Under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Plan , on the Admissions tab , select Add a New Step. Within the Edit box, set it up as follows: Name: Application Thank You Email Trigger: Select Checklist Item: Application Form *Check your work: You should see the text \"This step will trigger when the checklist item Application Form is completed\" underneath the trigger section. Additional Criteria: Apply Grade &gt; is not &gt; **select all waitlisted grades** Perform Action: Send Email At this time: Immediately Send to: All Parents Email template: **Find and select your custom application thank you email** Set Up an Automated Communication Plan for your Waitlisted Families: Next, add a new automated plan.

    "body": "Overview For schools utilizing our Text Messaging feature, when parents or guardians provide a cell phone number on a form, they are required to choose whether they wish to receive or opt out of receiving texts from your school. In this article Opt-In/Out on a Form Tracking Opt-In/Opt-Out Things to Keep in Mind Opt-In/Out on a Form If Cell is selected as the phone type within a form, a confirmation text will appear asking the parent/guardian to confirm whether or not they consent to receive text messages from the school. The message will contain your school's unique texting number. You can learn more about your number within our Text Messaging Overview article. When someone opts out, an attempt to send them messages through text will fail. Tracking Opt-In/Opt-Out On the record Within the record, wherever the phone number is listed, you will see a green circle to indicate that they opted in, or, a red circle to indicate that they opted out. Within a search You can build a search to list all parents/guardians who have opted out of receiving text messages. Start by selecting All other fields and, in the Field dropdown, select Role and then set that to 'is' Parent Add a second criterion to the search, again selecting to search with All other fields and, with this criteria, search the word \"Opt\". This should bring up your 3 opt-in fields for texting. (The field names may vary from site to site so it may not be exactly as pictured.) Select one of the Opt-In phone fields and set the criteria to 'is' No to see a list of everyone who has opted out. Alternatively, you may set it to 'is' Yes to list all parents who have opted in. Exporting We also have an export built specifically for exporting Opt-Out data. It provides info the parent ID, name, and number and type of all numbers they've opted out of. There is no charge for adding this export to your site. If you'd like our team to build this into your site, please reach out to our Support team . Things to Keep in Mind If you enter a Cell phone number on the record (rather than the parent entering it through a form), it will automatically be set up as Opt-In. You cannot manually set a cell phone number as Opt-Out on a parent's behalf. Parents can still select to Opt-Out at any time by responding to texts with \"STOP\" and opt back in via a form. Currently, recipients can not opt back by replying with \"Start\". Please refer to our Text Messaging Overview &amp; Best Practices article for more insight. Opt-In/Out can not be disabled while texting is enabled. If you have the Text Messaging feature enabled on your site and do not wish to display opt-in/out confirmation, the Texting feature would need to be disabled on your site.

Payment within the Form Checklist When a parent/payer pays an Application Form or AdHoc Form fee within the form itself, the checklist item for both the form and the fee will automatically be marked complete by the system within the checklist. Example of an Application fee payment within the checklist: Ledger When the fee is paid within the form itself, the ledger will automatically populate with both the charge and the payment simultaneously, upon payment. This means that the charge does not appear on the ledger until the payment is made. The parent/payer will see the charge and payment when they navigate to their ledger through the Billing Management tab. You'll see it when you navigate to their record and view their ledger through the Billing tab. Payment with Cash/Check or within the Billing Management Tab Checklist When a parent/payer brings in a cash/paper check payment or they go directly to the Billing Management Tab to pay for an Application or AdHoc fee, the checklist item will not be marked as complete. This must be done manually. When marking the checklist item as complete, please consider the following: Always enter the Amount paid in the Amount field. You'll never leave this blank or mark it as $0 when managing Application and AdHoc fee payments. When checking off the checklist item, you will also: select a payment method enter a description (optional) select a billing account (here you should select the parent/guardian that the charge and payment should appear on) and enter the date of the payment (optional) Ledger Once the checklist item is marked as complete, the charge and payment will appear on the billing ledger of the parent you selected when completing the item. As with the first scenario (parent/payer pays the fee on the form), you will be able to see this on the parent/payer's ledger under their billing tab and they will be able to see it when they navigate to the Billing Management tab in the ledger. Troubleshooting Unchecked Fee Checklist Item If the fee checklist item for an Application or Adhoc form fee is accidentally unchecked, both the charge and the payment will disappear from for both the Admin and the parent/payer. You can fix this by simply re-checking the checklist item. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Application Fee &amp; Waiver Codes Custom Form Fee Management",

    "body": "Overview SchoolDoc is a health record system designed specifically for K-12 schools and educational institutions. If your school is using SchoolDoc, we can build you an export that will allow you to transfer student data over to that system. In this article Export Setup How it works Export Setup If you're interested in getting started, please reach out to our Support team who will help start off the process. These fields will be required to create the Export.

Therefore, you'll need to work with SchoolDoc if you'd want additional data imported. How it works Once we've built your export and set up the initial steps, your process will primarily look like this: Use the export to pull enrolled student data out of our system. Work with SchoolDoc to import that data into their platform. Invite your families to navigate to SchoolDoc through an enrollment checklist item. When new students are added to your enrollment workflow, you can run an export for them and send them over to SchoolDoc. When you request a SchoolDoc export, our team will work with you on outlining the steps of how to use your export file to get the data out of Finalsite Enrollment and we'll help you set up a Checklist item allowing your families to easily navigate over to SchoolDoc. If you have a SchoolDoc account and would like to import student data into it, please reach out to our Support team as a first step.

    "body": "Overview Providing Autopay as an option saves time for your school and families. It helps you manage payments easily and speeds up the process of collecting them. For parents, it's simpler than remembering to pay bills manually every month. Read more about setting up and managing Autopay within this article. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: Admins, System Admins, and Users Permissions: Financial In this article Autopay Terminology How Autopay Works (In a Nutshell) Autopay Setup Autopay on the Parent Record Parent Facing Autopay Management Changing Autopay Dates Past Due and Autopay Autopay Reporting Autopay Communications Additional Workflows and Notes Skip a Payment For Schools Requiring Autopay: A Note about Disabling it Autopay Terminology Autopay Date: All of the date(s) that the system withdraws from a payer\u2019s account. This includes: Billing Date: This is the last Autopay Date of the month. The payer's account is not considered past due until this date has passed. Note: Past Due status still also depends on the overdue Threshold and Grace Period if your school has that set. Read more about Threshold and Grace Period within our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. Prepay Date: These are all of the Autopay Dates before the Billing Date. For example, if a payer has Autopay set to withdraw on the 1st, 15th, and 28th, the 1st and 15th are considered to be their Prepay Dates. How Autopay Works (In a Nutshell) For payers with 1 billing day a month: Autopay is pulled once a month on the payer\u2019s billing date. For payers with multiple billing days per month: Autopay is pulled on each of the payer's billing dates. For example, if the payer's dates are the 1st and the 15th, Autopay will automatically collect their balance on the 1st and the 15th of each month. Autopay Setup Autopay can be set up within the Billing Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). The Autopay Setup section of the Billing Setup page allows you to disable, preselect, or require autopay. You can also opt to Retry Failed Autopay Payments in this section. This allows the system to re-attempt to charge most* failed payments. You can read more about this feature in our Retry Failed Autopay Payments article. The Parent Facing Additional Payment Options section allows you to set whether or not the Autopay options will be available in the Parent Portal for payers to choose and set on their own. *While the system can re-attempt to charge most failed payments, some can not be reattempted. For example, the system can not re-attempt to charge a payment that fails due to a closed bank account. The Billing Setup section on the Billing Setup page lets you choose extra billing days for payers. Additionally, the Additional Billing Date Options section enables multiple monthly autopay withdrawals and select the dates that you'd like to offer. Our Settings: Billing Setup Page article outlines the details and specifics of setting up these Autopay options. Refer to the Billing Setup section of the article to learn about setting up and managing Billing Date options. Refer to the AutoPay Setup section of the article to learn about options for enabling Autopay. Autopay on the Parent Record Billing Overview Tab The overview tab of a parent/payer's record displays their Autopay dates and includes an option to change them. Example of the Overview Tab when the Change Autopay Days button is selected. Please refer to the Contact Record: Billing Tab article for more in-depth details of this section. Ledger Tab The Ledger tab on a parent/payer's record also displays their Autopay dates. Additional Notes regarding Autopay behavior on a payer's ledger. Incidental Charges Added Incidental charges will be withdrawn on the payer's next autopay date. Because of this, we recommend taking extra care to ensure that everything is correct when adding incidental charges to the ledger. Contract Charges on the Ledger : When the contract charges post, they will reflect the payer's multiple autopay dates (if set). If the autopay dates are changed, the contract charges on the parent/payer ledger will automatically update to reflect the new dates. Please note: The contract only breaks down the payment plan by the Default Billing Date you have set on the Billing Setup page . This is the case, even if the parent/payer has custom date(s) set up before submitting the contract. Parent Facing Autopay Management If you have enabled autopay and opted to set payment options parent-facing on the Billing Setup Page , your payers will see a Manage Autopay Dates section within their Billing Management tab in the portal. They will also see their Autopay dates listed above the ledger. If the payer selects Change Autopay Dates , they will see additional options for managing their autopay dates, depending on what you have set within the Billing Setup page. If you have hidden the option for payers to set their own dates*, they will not see the manage autopay dates section on the right side of their Billing Management tab but they will still see their autopay dates listed above the ledger. * The option for payers to change their dates is hidden when you don't select any of the Parent Facing Additional Payment Options on the Billing Setup page. For example: Changing Autopay Dates Autopay changes only affect future withdrawals. If the autopay date change affects past dates the change will not take place until the next billing month. This goes for both single and multiple autopay date accounts i.e. If one or more of the multiple autopay dates are being moved backward to date earlier than the current day, the changes will take effect the following month. Important Exception: For parents sharing financial responsibility, if one of the parents changes their autopay date to a date in the future, the change will only take effect that month if the other parent doesn\u2019t have any past dates. (see the last example below) Example Scenarios Scenario date: October 10th Agatha\u2019s Billing Date is the 17th. She updates it to the 1st. The change will take effect in November and she will be charged November 1st. Jane\u2019s Billing Date is the 15th, she changes it to the 20th. The changes take effect in October (she is charged on the 20th). (exception example) Jeff and Gianna have a 50/50 split. Jeff\u2019s billing dates are the 1st, 5th and 15th Gianna\u2019s date is the 15th. If Gianna changes her date to 20th, it won\u2019t take effect until next month because one of Jeff\u2019s dates has already passed. Changes from single to multiple autopay made after the first billing date will be initiated the following month. If a parent opts to switch from a single autopay day to multiple autopay days after the family's first billing charge of the month has passed, the change will not take effect until the following month. Example Scenario The Jenkins family has a single billing day each month (the 10th) and they are set up for autopay. Every month on the 10th, they are automatically charged their balance. Then, one month on the 14th, they decide to switch from single autopay to multiple autopay. Because their billing charge date (the 10th) has already passed, their new multiple autopay schedule will not take effect until the following month. Past Due and Autopay Payers with multiple autopay dates will be considered past due if they meet the criteria after the last autopay billing date of the month has passed. If the payer meets the criteria to be considered overdue, they will only be charged the Late Fee once that month. Payers with a single autopay billing date will be considered past due if they meet the criteria after their billing date has passed. Meeting the criteria to be considered overdue also depends on the Threshold and Grace Period being met if you have that setup. Autopay Reporting You can track Autopay data through the following reports within your site. Accounts The Accounts List Page Report ( Billing &gt; Accounts ) contains: The Billing Autopay Enabled filter option , which allows you to filter the report based on which of your accounts have Autopay enabled. The Autopay Billing Days column, which lists every account's Billing Day(s). The option to email families right from this page. You can filter to see only those enrolled in Autopay and select your families to open the communicate menu. You can read more about the Accounts report within this article: Billing: Accounts List Page Search &amp; Reports With a Search ( Search &amp; Reports &gt; Search ), you can: Use the Contact Record Data (everything else) criteria to search based on Autopay Billing Days or whether or not an account has Autopay enabled. Account Autopay Billing Days is a text field, so to search by that, you need to enter the date as a number and choose a symbol (greater than, less than, equal to, etc.). Because of this, it's likely not the most practical way to view that data. You may instead prefer to pull that data in as a column within the search. See the next bullet for details. Use Change Display/Columns to pull in Autopay data as columns within the report. First, use the following criteria to pull in parents with Autopay: Contact Record Data (everything else) &gt; Role is Parent AND Contact Record Data (everything else) &gt; Account Autopay Billing Days is not blank. Next, select Change Display/Columns and, under the Contact grouping, expand the Billing fields and select Account Autopay Billing Days and/or Billing Autopay Enabled . Read more about Billing Searches within our Billing: Search &amp; Reports article. Autopay Communications Autopay Merge Tokens {{statement.autopay_dates}} - the payer's autopay dates. These similar merge tokens pull in the same information: {{contact.autopay_billing_days}} and {{recipient.autopay_billing_days}} {{statement.formatted_next_autopay_amount}} - the payer's next amount due. {{statement.next_autopay_date}} - the payer's next autopay date. {{recipient.billing_autopay_enabled}} - whether or not the payer has autopay enabled. {{ statement.autopay_convenience_fee_disclaimer }} - Displays a message that informs the recipient of the convenience fee associated with their charge. {{ statement.formatted_autopay_convenience_fee_amount }} - Displays the amount of the convenience fee associated with the recipient's charge. Important Autopay tokens that begin with \"statement\" can only be used in the Billing Email Templates (Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails). They will not work if you put them in any other email template. Please refer to our Billing Merge Fields article for information on all Billing Merge tokens. Emails You have a few automated communications related to Autopay that are already set up on your site. (Read about those in this section.) You can also email families through the Accounts list page which includes a filter for Autopay. That means, you can filter down to get a list of all of your families with Autopay enabled and then send emails to them right from that list page. You can read more about that in our Account List page article. The templates for the below emails are found under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails. Each of the emails described below can be further customized on that page. The list below does not include all billing emails, but, rather, those that specifically relate to Autopay. You can read more detail about these and all Billing emails within our Billing Communications article. Billing Day Changed If you change a payer\u2019s billing date, they will immediately be sent the Billing Day Changed email. (remember, changes made to autopay don't take effect until the following month). Upcoming Auto Payment This email is sent 2 days before a payer\u2019s autopay prepay dates . As a reminder, the \"autopay prepay dates\" are all of the Autopay Dates before the Billing Date. For example, if a payer\u2019s autopay dates are the 8th, 15th, and 22nd: the 8th and the 15th are considered their \"autopay prepay dates\" and the 22nd is considered their \"billing date\". This payer will automatically receive the Upcoming Auto Payment email on the 6th and 13th, and then, two days before their final billing day of the month (the 20th in this example), the payer would receive the Upcoming Payment email. The timing of the email can not be altered. Upcoming Statement As a reminder, the timing of this email can be adjusted on the Billing Setup page. If a payer's 1st autopay date of the month is at least 10 days after their last autopay date of the month : this email will be sent 10 days before the payer\u2019s 1st autopay day of the month. If a payer's 1st autopay date of the month is less than 10 days after their last autopay date of the month: this email will be sent the day after their last autopay date of the month. Account Overdue When an account has multiple Autopay dates, the system designates the last autopay day of the month as the Billing Day. Consequently, if the account remains unpaid after this date, provided that both the grace period and threshold requirements are met, the account overdue email will be sent to the account. Auto Payment Failure Retry If you have Retry Failed Autopay Payments enabled on the Billing Setup page, this email is sent immediately whenever an Autopay payer's payment fails (so long as it fails due to an accepted reason - check out our article on this, linked below, for more insight on this). The email informs them of the payment failure and lets them know that the charge will be re-attempted. The message also contains the date that the autopay will be re-attempted on. You can read more about this feature in our Retry Failed Autopay Payments article. Rate Change This email is automatically sent to the affected parents who have autopay enabled when you update the rates for Credit Card or Electronic Fees that you are passing along them. Once you click Save after updating the rate on either the Credit Card or Electronic Check page, you'll see a confirmation pop-up box. If you click Confirm in that box, the rate will be updated and the email will automatically be sent to affected parents who have autopay enabled when you update the rates for Credit Card or Electronic Fees that you are passing along to parents. It's sent based on what you update and is only sent to active, applicable parents with autopay enabled. Only parents with autopay enabled who either have an upcoming charge or an unpaid past charge that will be pulled in the next autopay cycle will be emailed. For example: If you update the Credit Card convenience fee, only active parents with a Credit Card saved to autopay will be emailed. If you cancel the confirmation, the rate will not be updated and the email will not be sent. It can be updated in the Billing Email templates page: Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails Autopay Communication Recommendation As a best practice, we recommend the following updates to billing email templates to ensure clear communication around Autopay. You're school may have already changed these emails, if not, you will see the default text (current text) as listed below. Upcoming Statement: (change the statement.due_date merge token to the statement.autopay_dates merge token in the last paragraph.) Current text (last paragraph): 'If you are enrolled in Auto Pay, you will be automatically charged on {{statement.due_date}}. If you have any questions about this statement, please contact the school' Our recommended update: 'If you are enrolled in Auto Pay, you will be automatically charged on {{statement.autopay_dates}}. If you have any questions about this statement, please contact the school'. Billing Day Changed: (Add the {{statement.autopay_days}} merge token to the last paragraph.) Current text (last sentence in the first paragraph): 'If you have enabled automatic payments your account will also be drafted on this day.' Our recommended update: ' If you have enabled automatic payments your account will be drafted on the {{statement.autopay_days}} of the month.' Additional Workflows Skip a Payment If a parent needs to skip a payment, simply disable autopay for them for that month. To be safe, we recommend waiting until the 1st of the following month to re-enable autopay for the payer. Re-enabling Autopay will allow their balance to be withdrawn on their billing date of that month. For example, if you disable autopay for April to allow a payer to skip that month\u2019s payment, we recommend that you wait until May 1st to go back and re-enable autopay. Important: One word of caution on this, depending on the ledger, this may also mean that the parent may be faced with a larger payment the next month. Please keep this in mind when assisting payers with skipping payments by disabling autopay for a month. For schools requiring Autopay: A note about disabling it. If your school has Autopay set as required and you manually disable it for any one of your parents, Autopay can only be re-enabled for that parent if either: You re-enable it on the Admin side (by clicking the \u2018Enable Autopay\u2019 link on the parent\u2019s Billing &gt; Overview tab.) OR The parent adds a new payment profile within their Billing Management tab. This new profile will give them the option to enroll in Autopay again. Notes on this process: When the parent adds a new payment method and selects to Enroll in Autopay, the selection they make is locked in (the \u2018Enroll in Autopay\u2019 checkbox can not be unchecked). The parent can refresh their page or click back to get out of making this selection or they can proceed to finalize enrolling in Autopay.

    "body": "Overview From time to time we know that, unfortunately, you may be tasked with managing a family with a deceased guardian or parent. This article contains our recommendations for navigating this situation. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: System Admins &amp; Admins Permissions: Communication In this article Option 1: Deleting the Contact Option 2: Disconnect without Deleting Option 3: For Billing Contacts Option 1: Deleting the Contact *This is our recommended approach To ensure that the family doesn't receive any communications linked to their deceased loved one, we recommend deleting the contact record of the deceased individual and adding a note to the student's record to identify that they have a loved one that has passed on. Deleted records can not be recovered by our team. Please use caution when taking these steps. 1. Re-assign the Primary Parent This is only applicable if the deceased relative has a parent relationship and is assigned as the Primary parent, which is noted in the system with this icon: Navigate to the student's record, in the related contacts section. Click on the P icon and select another parent or guardian as the Primary parent. Repeat this step for any other student that has this individual set as their Primary parent. 2. Deleting the contact Navigate to the record of the deceased relative or guardian. From the Edit menu, select Delete Record . Select Confirm when prompted. Once you confirm, you'll be brought back to the Dashboard page and you'll see a confirmation message appear on the screen. You only have to do this once. This deletes the contact from the system and removes them from every student, parent, or relative that they were connected to. 3. Add a note to the student's record Navigate to the record of one of the students connected with the deceased relative. In the Recent Activity Section, select the plus icon to add a note. Enter the name of the deceased relative and a brief note. You do not have to add an activity type. Set the visibility (optional) and Save the note. Add notes to any other records that were attached to the relative. Option 2: Disconnect without Deleting If you do not wish to delete the relative or guardian from the system, you can alternatively opt to disconnect them from the student and family while adding a note to the student's record. 1. Re-assign the Primary Parent Refer to the steps in the above section: Re-assign the Primary Parent 2. Update their name Add (Deceased) to the end of the name of the deceased relative. Navigate to the record of the deceased individual. Select the Personal tab. Select Edit Fields . Under the Personal Information grouping, in the Last Name text box, add (DECEASED) to the end of the name. Select Save Edits . 3.

    "body": "Overview Weglot is a translation software that can be used within your site. It integrates seamlessly into your parent portal and will allow the parents/guardians to translate their view of the portal, checklists, and forms. In this article The Basics Setup FAQs Function FAQs The Basics Here's a quick high-level overview of what to know about Weglot. It translates the parent portal including, but not limited to your checklists, instructions, forms, buttons, and links. Please note, the only form exception is the Contract, as it cannot be translated for legal purposes. In addition, text fields, including essay fields that a student/parent enters on a form will not be translated. In other words, if a student answers an essay question in any other language, their answer is not translated to English when the form is submitted. If you are adding it for the first time, there is a cost involved which our team will outline for you. If you are already using it on the CMS side, we can add it to your EMS site. You can read our general FAQs below. You can find further resources on how to utilize Weglot within their Help Documentation . Setup FAQs What are the benefits of adding Weglot?

By signing up for Weglot, you can ensure that your parent portal translation functionality is fully operative and maintained in the long term. With Weglot, you have access to high-quality language translation services for over 100 languages, along with the ability to manually review and overwrite translations as needed. I'd like to add Weglot to my site, how do I start? Start by contacting our support team. If you aren't set up with Weglot, we'll have someone reach out to go over pricing and details first. I am a Finalsite CMS customer already using Weglot, can I add it to my EMS site? Yes, contact our Support team and we'll inform you of the next steps. We are set up with Google Translate, can we still use that? Yes, for schools that are not using Weglot, Google Translate is still an option. We do caution against its use, however, as Google has sunset its support for the free Google Translate for Websites widget, resulting in concerns about long-term functionality. Does it cost to use this product? Yes, our team will go over the pricing options with you when working on the setup. Function FAQs Where can I find documentation on how to use Weglot? You can find documentation and resources for using Weglot in their Help Center. Will Weglot translate buttons? Yes, all buttons and links within the parent portal and the forms are translated. What parts of the site does Weglot translate? Weglot only translates the parent side of things. It translates the entire parent portal including checklists, instructions, forms, etc. The only form it will not translate is the contract, which can not be translated for legal purposes. You can, however, preview a form translation on your side of things. Within any of your forms under Settings &gt; Forms, when you are previewing the form, you will have a translated menu at the bottom of the page. Selecting a different language from that menu allows you to preview the translation of the form you are viewing. Where does a Parent find the Weglot translate menu? The parent will see the language selection dropdown in their portal, next to the help center link. For example: How can I test out the parent experience? A good way to test out the experience on the parent end would be to use our Impersonation Feature. You can read more on this in our Impersonate article. Does Weglot translate the Admin view? No, the only place on your side of the portal that you can use for translation is within a form preview. When you are working on one of your forms under Settings &gt; Forms. In the preview of the form, at the bottom of the page, you have the language selection dropdown available which allows you to change the language and preview the translation of the form. Is there any form that Weglot does not translate? Yes, for legal purposes contracts will not be translated. This is the only form that will not be available to translate. In addition, any text or essay-style answers that a parent or student types into a form are not translated. The will remain in the original language that they were written in on the form. Are text fields translated? What about Essay questions? No, any text fields, including essay fields that the student/parents enter will not be translated when you view them. If you only wish answers within the form to be recorded in a specific language, we recommend that you include this instruction within your form for your families to note when filling in their answers.

The logo/name on your sites and Help Center will be changed. You don't need to take any action now. Your logins and site URLs will remain the same for the time being but will be updated later We will keep you informed and give you a heads-up when this approaches so that you have ample time and all the info you need when the time comes. You may choose to update the name where it appears on your site (for example, if you are using it within your email templates), but it's not required. The Artist Formerly Known as SchoolAdmin: Our Backstory SchoolAdmin joined the Finalsite family in 2021 around the premise that enrollment begins long before a family inquires \u2013 and that tools such as digital marketing, a school\u2019s website, and inbound marketing are just as important to yield and retention as a streamlined admissions process. As our teams came together, we also discovered a serious gap in how admissions departments collaborate with their marketing and communications counterparts. These lessons have informed a new set of integrations with Finalsite\u2019s inbound marketing tools that are making it easier for: Marketing teams to target prospective families once they enter the admissions funnel. Admissions teams to more easily leverage marketing assets to nurture families once they\u2019ve inquired. The renaming of our product to Finalsite Enrollment represents our work and commitment to further integrating Finalsite's website content management and communications tools \u2013 allowing schools to better manage their enrollment, communications, and marketing processes together. More importantly, we are working to streamline a family\u2019s online experience from discovery to paying tuition. So, welcome to Finalsite Enrollment! We look forward to continuing to serve you and your school community with the same level of excellence you have grown to depend on. The New Look What You Need to Know Changing Now Changing Later Not Changing We\u2019re updating the SchoolAdmin logo within the SchoolAdmin sites (and the Help Site). In the next year, we will also be updating client site URLs for more clarity across the parent experience. We will follow up with more info before this change occurs so that you have ample time to update portal references across your website. In the meantime, the links are staying the same. -Same commitment to Finalsite Enrollment as a standalone enrollment management product. -Same team members you've been working with since before the merger! -Same resources for help, training, and continued improvement of your workflow -Same emphasis on helping admissions teams collaborate more effectively with the other departments for whom enrollment is important, such as Marketing and the Business Office. Managing the Changes in Your Site With an exciting update like this, our team has been hard at work behind the scenes to update the name within our help center and most places within your site. We also realize that you may have added our original name (SchoolAdmin) to some of your communications. It is not urgent or required but, as a best practice, we recommend updating the name from \"SchoolAdmin\" to \"Finalsite Enrollment\" wherever you are currently using it. You might consider checking the following areas: Email Templates , Letters , or Text Messages Parent Portal Content Templates Calendar Emails Checklist Item Descriptions Forms Your School's Website Having the name up to date will ensure the clearest communications between you and your families. FAQs Do we need to take any immediate action? Nope! All that is happening is that our team is changing the name and logo within your SchoolAdmin site and the Help Site. The only thing we are recommending on your end (not required) is that you may want to consider updating the name from SchoolAdmin to Finalsite Enrollment where you are using it within emails, letter templates, etc. This is by no means a requirement and just a friendly recommendation. Please see the Managing the Changes in Your Site section of this article for more insight into this. Will we need new logins? Nope, no need to worry about new logins! That all will remain the same. New links to our accounts? No, there are no new links to your accounts. In the next year, we will be updating client site URLs for more clarity across the parent experience.

    "body": "Overview Within Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Design , you can add custom CSS to change the design of certain aspects of your portal. This article provides a simple overview of how to add basic CSS elements and what they will affect. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types : System Admins and Admins Permissions: Any In this article Introductory Notes Basic Definitions of Some Common CSS Elements Adding a Background Adjusting the Top of the Page Adjusting the Bottom of the Page CSS Learning Resources Introductory Notes What is CSS and where can I add it? CSS is the language used to style an HTML document (website). Custom CSS can be added to your parent portal within Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Design . Adding custom CSS to your parent portal will control the way certain parts of the portal appear. Helpful Notes Regarding Adding Custom CSS to your site: You have to save the changes (bottom of the page) to see them in action in the parent portal. It's very important to preview any changes you make to the custom CSS to ensure they look as you expect. Click here to review how to view the parent portal from the parent's perspective. If you need to go back to the default simply delete all of the custom CSS and then save. It's best practice to save your coding within a text editor, like Sublime . Saving the coding within a text editor will help you keep track of what you are adding. Basic Definitions of Some Common CSS Elements CSS group selector: The label of the area where you'd like to adjust. For example, \"footer\" is the selector for editing the footer of a page. See the Adjusting the Bottom of the Page section below for a visual example. CSS id selector (#): The label for editing a more specific area of the page. It starts with a hashtag. For example, #content-body will specifically adjust the top of the parent portal box. See the Adjusting the Top of the Page section below for a visual example. CSS class selector (.): The label or editing of a specific area of the page. It starts with a period. For example, .btn will adjust the styling of the buttons within your parent portal. Box-Shadow : A shadow effect for the area around a box (or area of the screen). Border-Radius: Rounds the corners of an area or box (can be added to round the top or bottom of the parent portal screen in front of the background). Border-Top: Sets up the properties of how the border will appear. Margin-Bottom: This dictates the margin area of the bottom of an area or box (the margin at the bottom of the parent portal where the background shows). Hex code: A code that describes the hexadecimal color syntax of a color. It's used within portal design to designate the color of different aspects of the parent portal. Hex codes can also be used to customize other items within your site such as checklist item descriptions and email templates. Margin (right, left, top, bottom): Sets the margin area of the sides of an element within your site. For example, in the coding provided below, margins are set in the Background and Footer page elements. Adding a Background If you have a background image that you would like to set within your portal you can use the CSS selector background followed by opening and closing brackets. Within the brackets, add your code. Please note, adding background images can be a bit complex and many different options affect the layout/view of the image. You'll want to test and preview the update in the parent portal to ensure the background looks like you'd want it to. Here is an external resource for understanding the coding elements of adding a background: https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_background.asp If you'd like to add a solid background color as opposed to an image, you can add the HEX code for the color within the Parent Portal Design page within the Background Color box. Here is an example of custom CSS code created to add a background. body { background-position: top center; background-image: url(INSERT THE URL OF THE IMAGE); background-repeat: none; background-size: cover; background-position: top center; background-attachment: fixed; margin-right: auto; margin-left: auto; margin-top: 0px; padding: 0px; } Please note, regarding the above code snippet, you won't be able to just copy/paste the above code, you first must insert the URL that you would like to use where it's noted: background-image: url(INSERT THE URL OF THE IMAGE); Example image of a Parent Portal background using a solid color rather than adding a background image using custom CSS. The Hex code (color) of the background in this example is: fefae0 Example image of a Parent Portal background was added using the custom CSS in the example above Adjusting the Top of the Page For the top of the parent portal, you can use a CSS id selector to edit the top of the white box (in front of the background). You can use the id selector #content-body followed by opening and closing brackets. Within the brackets, add your code. Here is an example of CSS code used to design the top of the Parent Portal page. #content-body { border-top: none; border-radius: 8px 8px 0 0; box-shadow: 0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); } Example image of the portal before adding custom CSS to design the top of the page. Notice the top of the white box and edges that are right angles (not curved). Example image of the portal after adding custom CSS to design the top of the page. Notice the top of the white box has changed and the edges now are curved. Adjusting the Bottom of the Page To add CSS that adjusts the footer area of the parent portal which is the area at the bottom of the screen, you can start with the text footer followed by opening and closing brackets. Within the brackets, add your code. Here is an example of CSS code used to design the footer area of the Parent Portal: footer { box-shadow: 0 8px 16px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); border-radius: 0 0 8px 8px; margin-bottom: 80px; } Example image of the portal before adding the above code. Notice there is no margin at the bottom to view the background. Example image of the portal after adding custom CSS to redesign the way the footer appears . Notice the background is now visible (because a margin was added) and the edges of the box are curved (because a border-radius was added). CSS learning resources You can learn more about CSS through an online resource such as W3 Schools: https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp Their site includes a sandbox feature that allows you to explore while learning about different CSS elements.

In this article How to Merge Billing Records How to Delete Billing Records How to Merge Billing Records Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: Only System Admins + Admins can merge contacts. Permissions: Data Within Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Duplicate Contact Matching you can merge duplicate records, this includes records that have Billing ledgers/accounts attached to them. Merging an account with Billing Navigate to the Duplicate Contact Matching page, Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Duplicate Contact Matching. Select Resolve next to the contact you wish to merge. Within the Resolve Duplicate dialogue box you will be able to review the data related to the contacts as well as their current, next and total balances. If you'd like to continue with the merge select Yes, merge them! Select whether you wish Contact 1 or Contact 2 to take precedence in the merge. The contact you select as the winning record will be the one whose information the system keeps in the case of conflicting data. If the merge is successful, you will see a pop-up alert letting you know. The pop-up says, \"Duplicates merged successfully.\" If you are unable to resolve the merge, you may try using the Duplicate Check and Merge option, or, contact our support team for help. Ledger Behavior The ledger of the contact that you selected to take precedence will be updated with all of the data from the duplicate ledger. The items will appear exactly as they were on the duplicate ledger, including posting to the same date and term that the charge was added in. The Audit tab will also be populated with all of the data from the Audit tab of the ledger that was merged into the remaining record. Additional Important Notes The system allows Billing records to be merged using the bulk merge feature within the Duplicate Contact Matching Page. We recommend that you always use caution when opting to merge duplicate records in Bulk, especially Billing records. Other than manually correcting the issue by creating a new record for the merged individual and manually adding all lost data, there is no way to undo a merged account. You can also merge duplicate Billing records manually through the Duplicate Check &amp; Merge Page . (Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Duplicate Check &amp; Merge) Click here to read more about the process of merging records from this page. Please see this article for more detailed information on the Duplicate Contact Matching page and please refer to this article for more detailed information on the Duplicate Check &amp; Merge page. How to Delete Billing Records Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: Only System Admins + Admins can delete contacts. Permissions: Any It is possible to delete a contact that has a billing account, however, the contact must be able to meet certain criteria for this to be allowed. To be deleted, the contact must: Not have any Electronic Payments attached to their ledger. Be set to 0% financially responsible in the current term and all previous ones for all students that they are connected to. Please keep in mind that this action can not be undone and it will permanently remove all data directly associated with the record. If there is a duplicate record that you are trying to resolve, merging the two records might be a more suitable option to preserve all data. Removing the percentage of financial responsibility If the contact has a percentage of financial responsibility assigned to them, you will need to start by setting them back to zero in all terms that they hold a percentage in. This is accomplished within the Parent Portal Access tab of the student's record. Open a tab with all students that the parent/guardian is attached to. Percentage is assigned on a per-student basis, so, you will need to clear the percentage on all students that the parent is attached to. Navigate to the Parent Portal Access of each student. Within this tab, click on any of the percentages in the FIN. SPLIT column. For each term necessary, set the parent/guardian you wish to delete to 0%. You must move the percentage of the financial split to another payer in the process. At least one of the remaining parent/guardians must retain a percentage of financial responsibility, whether you move 100% to another payer or split the responsibility between remaining guardians. You must do one term at a time, setting the parent/guardian to 0% then saving the change by clicking Submit, and then repeating the action in any other term that the parent holds a percentage in. If they are already set to 0% in all of the terms, no action is necessary. Repeat this process on all students that are attached to the parent/guardian. Deleting the contact To delete the parent/guardian, you must navigate to their record and use the Delete Record option from the Edit menu. Deleting a record does not transfer any of their Billing items to any other record nor does it save any of the data on the deleted account. Please review the ledger of the parent/guardian before attempting to delete their record as you may need to transfer outstanding charges or other ledger records to the ledger of another parent/guardian. Navigate to the parent/guardian's record. Select Edit &gt; Delete Record . Select Confirm within the Are you sure? dialogue box. If the deletion is successful, you will see a confirmation message appear in a green box. If the account can not be deleted, you will see a red box with a note with the reason that the account can not be deleted.

    "body": "Overview Schools using the Continuous Enrollment feature will have additional workflows to consider when it's time to rollover returning students in preparation for the next term. This article outlines the options for managing this process, as well as some important notes specific to our schools that have the Billing Module. If you'd like to read more about continuous enrollment and how to set it up within your site, click here. Managing Contracts after Rollover Option 1: Allowing families a timeframe to go in and select a different payment plan before bulk submitting contracts. Rollover all returning students. Generate contracts for all students (new and returning). Communicate to your families that the contract is an optional form for parents to fill out if they want to update their payment plan by a certain deadline. Then, on your selected deadline, bulk submit any remaining returning student contracts that haven't been already submitted with payment plan changes. You can bulk submit contracts within the Enrollment &gt; Students in Enrollment page. You can read more about bulk submitting contracts here. Option 2: Bulk submit all returning contracts while giving families options to communicate payment plan changes to you by contacting the school or submitting a custom payment plan form. Rollover all returning students. Upon rollover, immediately bulk submit all returning student contracts using the continuous enrollment feature. You can bulk submit contracts within the Enrollment &gt; Students in Enrollment page. You do not have to generate contracts in order to submit them internally in bulk. You can read more about bulk submitting contracts here. If parents would like to make changes to their payment plan, you have two options: Send an enrollment email that instructs families to contact the business office if they need to make changes to their payment plan. Payment plan adjustments would then be made by an admin within the ledger. Add an optional Payment Plan form for returning students. This option is good for schools that anticipate a lot of payment plan changes. The form would be assessable via the student checklist and set to only show for returning students. Parents would complete this form if they want to make a change to their payment plan. You would monitor the form submission so that you can go into the ledger and make the requested changes. We also recommend setting up an internal automated communication plan with a trigger of this form/checklist item being marked complete so that you're notified and can update the payment plan as soon as you receive the email or notification. Term-Based Fields and Continuous Enrollment Term-based fields automatically clear out upon rollover. What this means for Continuous Enrollment: If you have fields that are term based that drive your tuition, such as Scholarship and Aid, you should upload the amounts granted into the fields before checking off the contracts in bulk. You can read more about term-based fields here . Click here to learn more about using an import template to update current students in bulk. Notes for Billing Schools: Ledger Population and Payment Plans Bulk submitting contracts will submit contracts and will automatically populate the ledger. The tuition and fees on the returning student contracts will follow the fee rules for the current term. Reminder : Term-based fields clear out upon rollover. Scholarships and aid in term-based fields will not carry over into their new contract and must be added to the students before bulk-submitting contracts. Click here to learn more about using an import template to update current students in bulk. When bulk submitting contracts: Deposit Behavior The deposit will post to the ledger on the date you bulk submits contracts, and, for those with autopay set up, it will be automatically charged on the next billing date. Reminder: The deposit checklist item is required for contract generation if there is one present and if the \u2018collect deposit\u2019 button is checked on the deposit tab. Once contracts have been generated, there are options for hiding the checklist item for returners. Read more on this below in our recommended best practices. Our recommended best practices for deposit management You should bulk submit contracts in alignment with when you want the deposit collected and, ideally, this should be at least 10 days before their billing date so that parents see it when they get the automated upcoming statement and payment emails. Options for hiding the deposit checklist item from returners as a way to prevent any confusion for your returning families regarding how/where the deposit will be paid: If allowing parents a timeframe to go in and select a new payment plan: After the change timeframe, the deposit checklist item for that term can be hidden from all returning families by changing the checklist rules. If bulk submitting all returning contracts immediately after rollover: After generating contracts, the deposit checklist item for that term can be hidden from all returning families by changing the checklist rules. Click here to read more about editing checklist items. FAQs For schools that use our Billing Module: How will the upcoming year's fees be applied to individual ledger accounts for returning families? This occurs automatically when you bulk submit contracts for your returning families. For returning students, you should first perform rollover and then check off the contract in bulk using the continuous enrollment feature. Read more about that here . This will lock families in with their payment plan selection from the previous term. This action also automatically populates the ledger with the upcoming year's tuition. Note on contract fees: The tuition and fees on the returning student contracts will follow the fee rules for the current term. What if the tuition needs to be grandfathered? If the tuition needs to be grandfathered, the contract fee rules should be set up to charge different amounts by grade.

Within this article Tag Examples Creating and Editing Tags Adding Tags to Communication Templates Adding Tags to Saved Searches Filter Options and Bulk Actions Tag Examples Tags are completely customizable and defined by the needs of your school. To get you started, some example tags could include, but aren't limited to: Workflow Area: Inquiry, Events, Admissions, Enrollment, Billing, etc Admin Name: This may be useful for anyone managing manual communications or identifying a pre-built email template with an Admin's signature and information. Grade or School Level: This may be useful for grade-specific communications or searches. Interest-Based Tags: This is useful for organizing academic or athletic-specific communications/searches. Automated Communication Plan Tag (Pro Users only): For schools with Finalsite Enrollment Pro, you have automated communication plans (ACPs). You can create a tag called 'Admissions ACP' to easily locate the email templates tied to an automated communication plan. Creating and Editing Tags Create a new Tag Navigate to Settings &gt; General &gt; Tags Select Add a new Tag. Within the Add Tag dialogue box, enter the name of the new tag. Click Save . Edit or Delete a Tag On the right side of the page, you will see the option to Edit or Delete your tag. Edit: This will allow you to edit the tag name. Delete: This will allow you to delete the tag. If you select to delete a tag that is in use in other templates or searches, the system will warn you, letting you know it will be removed from all of the templates or searches it is used on. Additional Notes: You can not create duplicate names. When a tag name has already been created, the system will display an error if you try to create a tag with the same name. Adding Tags to Communication Templates Tags can be added to any custom template within the following pages: Custom Email Templates Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Custom Email Templates Letter Templates Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Letter Templates Label Templates Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Label Templates Text Message Templates Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Text Message Templates Within these pages, tags can be added by either editing an existing template or adding a new one. Adding a Tag to a New Template Start by selecting the Add a new template link at the top of the template page. Within the Edit Template dialogue box, you can select one or more tags. Click Save when you are done creating the template. Depending on which template page you are on (email, letter, etc), the experience will look slightly different.

These accounts are expected to pay on time on their billing date and the projected amounts here should be accurate to what you will receive. Manual: The account is current but does not have autopay turned on. The account holders will pay manually in the parent portal billing tab or by submitting cash or a paper check. These accounts are at higher risk of missing their payments because they are not utilizing Auto-pay. Overdue: These accounts are currently overdue. The system assumes that the account will stay overdue until they become current, therefore, any charge added to overdue accounts will increase the amount in the Overdue column. If the account remains overdue for more than a month, the amount owed will shift to the next month's Overdue column. The system will continue moving unpaid accounts in the overdue column until the account becomes current. The report can be exported to a CSV or PDF. Read more within our Projected Income Report article. -- In-School Payment Report The In-School Payments Report, located within the Billing menu, allows you to view and track all payments that have been manually added to your site.

    "body": "Overview Split Contracts is a feature that will automatically divide the amounts owed on a student contract based on the percentage of financial split assigned to the student\u2019s parent/guardian(s). In this article Setup Process Parent Experience Split Contracts and Dual Signature Admin Experience Payer-Specific Overrides How to set the overrides on a student Split Contracts and Continuous Enrollment Setup Our team must enable this feature for you. If you do not already have the Split Contracts feature enabled and would like us to turn it on within your site, please contact our support team. Please note, this feature is only available if your school is utilizing our Billing Module. Process When the feature is enabled, if a student has a financial split set for their parent/guardians, the system will automatically divide the total amount owed (including the deposit, aid, required fees, and payment plan fees) on the student\u2019s contract based on the percentage assigned to each parent/guardian. If Split Contracts are enabled within your site, other than ensuring that the student has a financial split assigned, no other actions are necessary for this to work. Read more about setting financial splits here . If you need to assign payers a specific amount for a required fee or aid (rather than having it divided automatically based on the financial split percentage), you can enable ' Allow Payer-Specific Overrides ' for the fee within the Contract Fees page. Setting a fee up to allow Payer-Specific Overrides is only available as an option if you have Split Contracts enabled on your site. In addition, Deposits and Required fees marked \u2018add to deposit\u2019 cannot be payer-specific at this time. Read more about Payer Specific Overrides below. Parent Experience Parent Experience at a Glance. One of the parents/guardians logs in and: completes the contract, selects a payment plan, and pays their portion of the deposit + any other fees they owe. The other parent/ guardian logs in, they see a Pay Deposit button and do not have access to the contract. They pay their portion of the Deposit and Fees. Please note that there is no option for the second parent to select a payment plan or make changes to the contract. Once both parents/guardians have paid their portion of the Deposit and fees, the contract and deposit will be marked as complete. A pdf version of the contract will now be available for both parents to view. A More Detailed Outline of the Parent Experience Either parent can log in and sign/pay their deposit at any time. When completing the contract, the parent will not have the ability to toggle between payers (as the admin view allows). The parent view of the contract totals page will show their percentage owed in the first column and the total amounts owed in the second column. The totals column shows the total amount of the normal fee without discounts or overrides. That amount may or may not match the actual amount collected. This is to protect a parent from seeing that the other parent received a larger or additional discount/fee. After one of the parents pays their portion of the deposit, an automated email is triggered. This email goes to the second payer to remind them the contract is ready for their review and that they may now pay their portion of the deposit. The system will only allow each payer to pay for themselves. It doesn't allow a payer to make a deposit payment on behalf of another payer. Once the first payer pays the amount owed, their portion of the process is complete. They will see a confirmation page that looks similar to the one pictured below. The system will not allow them to pay the other payer's deposit from this page either. If they select their name, they will see a confirmation message reminding them the deposit has already been paid. Now that the first parent has paid their portion of the deposit, an automated email is triggered. This email goes to the second payer to remind them the contract is ready for their review and that they may pay their portion of the deposit. You can read about this and other automated emails in our System Emails article. When a second payer or any other additional payer logs into Finalsite Enrollment, they will see the ' Pay Deposit ' button. They do not have contract access at this time and, therefore, can not make changes to the contract or select a different payment plan. Clicking this button will bring the parent to the payment page where the portion that they owe for the deposit and any fees due at the time of signing will be displayed. Once all payers have completed their payment, they will see and have access to the pdf view of the contract and both the Contract and Deposit checklist items will be marked as complete. IMPORTANT: The contract and deposit checklist items will not be marked as complete until all payers have submitted their payments. The contract will remain in Pending Payment until both payers have paid. If you are utilizing the countersign feature, the contract will transition to Pending Countersign at that time. The contract pdf will show the total amounts owed for the student's tuition, fees, and aid. It does not display a divided amount. Once the contract has been submitted, when a payer logs in and navigates to their Billing Management tab, they will see their ledger populated with the tuition and fees they owe based on their percentage of financial responsibility. Split Contracts and Dual Signature For Schools utilizing both the Split Contracts and Dual Signatures features, the workflow functions differently. Here's a breakdown of the process. Important note: For the deposit to be paid, both signers must have completed their signature on the contract. Here is what the parent/guardian will see after the first signer completes and signs the contract: Process overview 1. One of the parents/guardians signs in &gt; and completes the contract (including answering all questions and selecting a payment plan). After signing the contract, the parent is prompted to invite the second signer. 2. The second parent/guardian will receive the email invitation to complete their signature. Upon logging in, the second parent/guardian will select the \u2018Review and Sign Document\u2019 button. They will be able to review the contract and then, add their signature and submit the contract. 3. Once the second parent/guardian has completed their signature, they will be brought to the deposit payment page where they will be able to pay their portion of the deposit, based on the percentage of the financial split that they owe. They can also leave the page and come back later to pay their deposit via the checklist. Please note: once the signature of both parties is complete, the deposit payment is unlocked. The first parent/guardian can access and pay their deposit through the checklist as soon as both parents/guardians have signed. They do not have to wait for the second signer to pay their portion of the deposit. To read more about the Dual Signature option, please refer to this article . Admin Experience When previewing the contract on a student's record, on the payment summary page, you will see a dropdown arrow in both the Tuition and Fees section and the Totals Summary section next to the payer's name and split amount. This dropdown menu will allow you to toggle between viewing the amounts owed for each parent/guardian. See the video below to view this in action. Throughout the process, you will still have access to the impersonate feature , allowing you to see the workflow from the parent's perspective. On the student checklist, the contract will change to a 'Pending Payment' state while awaiting payment from all financially responsible payers. Once all deposit payments have been made, the deposit checklist item will be marked as complete and the contract will either change to a ' Pending Countersign ' state (if you are utilizing the Countersign feature - read more on this here ) or to a ' Submitted ' state. After the first payer has paid the deposit: After both payers have paid the deposit: When the contract is considered submitted, the checklist item will be automatically marked as complete. Payer-Specific Overrides Opting to Allow Payer-Specific Overrides on a contract fee means that you can manually set the amount each financially responsible payer will owe for a fee or is granted for any discount. In other words, rather than the amount on the contract being automatically assigned based on the percentage the payer owes, you can use these special fields to override this and dictate a specific amount owed by each payer. For example, you have a family with a 50/50 split where two payers are assigned to pay 50% of the tuition and fees, however, all of the aid should go to one of the parents. In this case, you would utilize the Payer-Specific Override fields to manually assign the aid to one of the payers. How to enable Payer-Specific Overrides on a fee or discount Please note: Setting a fee up to allow Payer-Specific Overrides is only available as an option if you have Split Contracts enabled on your site. In addition, Deposits and Required fees marked \u2018add to deposit\u2019 cannot be payer-specific at this time. You must start by enabling this option on your contract fees page: Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Contract Fees. Select ' Edit ' on the right side of the page to open the ' Contract Fee Details ' dialogue box for the fee or discount you wish to adjust. Check the ' Allow Payer-Specific Overrides ' box and click ' Submit ' How to set the overrides on a student Payer-Specific fields will be found on the student's record, under their ' Enrollment ' tab. Within the Enrollment tab, you will see a grouping with the header, ' Payer-Specific Tuition Assistance &amp; Fees '. This grouping will contain a list of all financially responsible payers and will list all fees that are set up to 'Allow Payer-Specific Overrides'. Additional Notes: The 'Payer-Specific Tuition Assistance &amp; Fees' grouping on the enrollment tab does not appear until financial responsibility is set for at least one of the student's contacts. Read more about financial responsibility settings and functions, here. To update : Select the ' Edit Fields ' button. Enter the amounts within the field boxes (You do not need to enter any negative signs or dollar signs). Click ' Save Edits. ' You should then preview the contract to ensure the fees/aid are displaying how you expect. Important: If no amount is entered into the \u2018Payer Specific Field\u2019 for a parent, the amount assigned will be dictated by the financial split, regardless of whether an amount is entered for the other parent. Therefore, when you are overriding a fee or discount within the 'Payer-Specific Tuition Assistance &amp; Fees' grouping, even if you are assigning 100% of it to go to just one of the parents, you must assign a value to both parents, even if the value is 0.0. For example, if one of the parents/payers is receiving 100% of any scholarship or aid, you must still set the other financially responsible payers a value of 0.0 within that scholarship field. Otherwise, the system will still assign the other payers a scholarship amount based on their percentage. Remember, any adjustments made to the contract after it's been signed will require regeneration if you need to display the updated amounts on the contract. Read more about your options for Contract regeneration here. Split Contracts and Continuous Enrollment If your school is using Continuous Enrollment and Split Contracts, there are a few things that you should keep in mind. New Families: The Split Contracts feature will work as expected for your new families. The workflow and experience will correspond with what is outlined in this article. Returning Families: You'll likely be using the Bulk Submit feature to internally submit contracts for your returning families. Please note that at this time, the Deposit will not be split when the contract is submitted internally through the Bulk Submit feature, even if a financial split is present. When bulk submitting contracts internally, if you have a financial split assigned to the family, the system will divide the tuition and fees according to the percentage of the financial split, but the full charge for the deposit will only appear on one of the parent's ledgers.

    "body": "Overview Some schools may have workflows that require a workaround for an efficient connection between Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS. These workflows include but are not limited to the following: Different enrollment dates for new and returning students. Continuous enrollment for returning students. Read below to learn more about our recommendations for these cases. New and Returning Students have different enrollment dates Some schools offer enrollment to returning students and new students at different times. This becomes an issue for existing families who are adding another child to the school. The new sibling must have a signed contract in order for the family to push to FACTS as the FACTS link will not appear for anyone in the family until all active student contracts are signed (including the contract for any sibling in Admissions). Recommended Workflow Options: Option 1. Have returning families who are adding a new student complete their enrollment but wait to push to FACTS: 1 A . If a deposit needs to be collected for the returning student in advance of the new student completing the contract: Collect the deposit for the returning student on the contract. Or collect the deposit for the returning student on an intent to enroll form and have the fee and payment displayed on the contract and pushed to the correct billing categories in FACTS. 1 B. Accept and enroll new students of existing families early along with your returning students. Important : You should add a note to the FACTS checklist description that says: Returning families adding a new student will need to wait until new student enrollment is offered and completed in order to set up their FACTS agreement. Please complete the FACTS checklist item at that time. Click here to learn more about how to add/update checklist item language. Option 2. Should ONLY be used for one-off situations - If you have small exceptions where a sibling has not been accepted yet or is unsure if they will enroll, but you need to push the returning student to FACTS now, you can temporarily place the 'unsure' sibling in an inactive status. This will allow the returning sibling to set up their FACTS agreement. Important note : Families can only push to FACTS once . If the other sibling enrolls at a later date, the FACTS integration can no longer be used since it's a one-time push of tuition and fees. The following steps will need to take place: The sibling will need to be manually added to FACTS. The FACTS checklist item in Finalsite Enrollment will need to be checked off manually by an Admin at your school. Option 3. Not recommended - Place all new students in a custom inactive admissions status. Continuous Enrollment Some schools offer continuous enrollment and do not require returning families to complete a contract yearly. This creates an issue as all students in a household must sign a contract in order for the FACTS integration button to appear. Schools using continuous enrollment should ONLY use the SSO integration. Recommended Workflow Options: Option 1: SSO should be the only integration used by schools with continuous enrollment. This means that the school will need to manually set up all FACTS agreements and simply offer a direct SSO to FACTS. You can read more about the SSO integration here. Option 2: The web-provided integration is not recommended for continuous enrollment schools . However, if web provided is needed, there is an option to use bulk contract submission for returning students. IMPORTANT NOTE : This option requires returning students to log into Finalsite Enrollment and push the FACTS button to set up their FACTS agreement. This is not a commonly used option, but some schools still have items such as emergency forms in Finalsite Enrollment for returning students to complete and find this to be a better solution than manual entry.

    "body": "Overview FACTS is a software that offers tuition management through different platforms. The Finalsite Enrollment platform has a partnership with FACTS to offer an integration for Tuition Management. Please note : Finalsite Enrollment only integrates with FACTS Tuition Management. There is currently no integration option between Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS's other platforms. We offer two options for integrating with FACTS: Single Sign-on (SSO) and Web-provided . For most schools who would like to integrate Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS, we recommend using the Web-provided option. However, schools that utilize continuous enrollment should only use the SSO integration. Below, you can read more about the differences between these two options, and, at the bottom of this article, you will find links to our collection of FACTS integration articles that cover each option in more detail along with unique workflow best practices. In this Article Single Sign-On Web-Provided Troubleshooting Parent Errors Single Sign-On (SSO): Recommended for schools with continuous enrollment . To learn more details about the Single Sign-On integration, click here . The enrollment checklist will have a FACTS button which the parents will use to navigate to FACTS. The FACTS checklist item button is available as soon as the student enters enrollment (the contract does not need to be submitted first) Fees are NOT passed over to FACTS. The school will be manually adding tuition/fees/scholarships into FACTS. Once in FACTS, the parent will set up their payment plan. Please note : They are setting up their payment plan without seeing their schedule, they will see that once the agreement is finalized by the school. Once the parent has completed setting up their payment plan, the school will see them in FACTS as \u201cpending\u201d and the FACTS checklist item will be checked off in Finalsite Enrollment. The school will then upload all tuition/fees/scholarships into FACTS for their pending students. Web-Provided (recommended): Recommended for schools that are NOT using continuous enrollment. To learn more details about the Web-Provided integration, click here . The enrollment checklist will have a FACTS button which will only become clickable once all students within a family that are active in Finalsite Enrollment have submitted a contract. Tuition/Fees/Scholarships will automatically be transferred over to FACTS when the parent accesses FACTS through the checklist item. Once the parent completes the agreement in FACTS, the checklist item will be automatically marked as complete. Troubleshooting Parent Issues When a parent runs into an error message on the FACTS end, you may not be able to see the error by using the Impersonate feature in Finalsite Enrollment. There's a possibility you'll be blocked by an authentication requirement. Here's what we recommend: First, try to see the FACTS error by impersonating the parent. If you are not blocked by multi-factor authentication, you should be able to see an error message toward the top of the screen. Take a screenshot or write down the exact error message and send it to our team so that investigate further. If you are blocked by a requirement to authenticate, we recommend the following: Ask the parent exactly what the error message says and have them send you a screenshot of the error if possible. Send the error message language and (when applicable) a screenshot of the error to our Support team. We'll work with FACTS and your school to help ensure that the error is clear! Keeping an eye on errors on your end We recommend that you create a test student in Finalsite Enrollment and set yourself up as their parent with a test account on the FACTS side. You can use this to make sure your FACTS account is set up correctly. Ideally, you should make sure to use this test student to check your integration before sending out contracts to ensure that your families won't run into any preventable issues. Some common issues and what they mean: Term Code Error: This means FACTS has not enabled the term or the active terms do not match in Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS. Contact our team for support. Account Code Error: This means there is a code or codes that do not match in Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS. Contact our team for support. Grade Error: This means that the grade doesn't match in FACTS with the way that it's written in Finalsite Enrollment. For example, we may list a grade as \"K\" in Finalsite Enrollment, which is listed as \"Kindergarten\" in FACTS. Contact our team for support. The FACTS button is hidden on the checklist: This one can be managed on your end! The FACTS link will be hidden if any siblings are still in an active admissions status (regardless of their term). Manage this by moving all kids in the family to either an Enrollment status with a completed contract or an 'inactive' Admissions status.

    "body": "Overview With the FACTS Web-Provided integration, there is a one time push of tuition and fees are passed from Finalsite Enrollment to FACTS. This integration option is for schools that have yearly contracts/registration forms, and cannot be used for schools with continuous/Evergreen enrollment contracts . Payment plan options do not roll over year to year for returning families, which means all families (new and returning) must complete a contract each year and pick their payment plan within FACTS. Web-Provided Integration (Yearly Contracts) To utilize the Web-Provided integration with FACTS, all students (new and returning) must complete a contract each year. It cannot be used for just new students or just returning students. This integration allows all tuition and fee amounts on the contract/registration form to be passed over by clicking on a FACTS button within the Enrollment Checklist. Important Note About Tuition or Fee Changes: The integration is a one-time push of tuition and fees from Finalsite Enrollment to FACTS. If any tuition or fee amounts have changed after the FACTS checklist item has been marked complete, a manual adjustment of fees is required by the school within FACTS. Parents can then complete the tuition management sign-up and confirmation process within FACTS. The completion of this step will mark the 'FACTS' checklist item complete in the enrollment checklist for both Admins and parents. Parent Workflow Complete Contract(s) to Access FACTS A Parent completes the online Enrollment Contract/Registration form through Finalsite Enrollment. All Contracts for the family need to be submitted within Finalsite Enrollment before going to FACTS. Tuition and fees are included in this contract. Important Note about FACTS Checklist Access : The FACTS link will be hidden if there are any siblings who are still in an active admissions status (regardless of their term). Active Admissions statuses include Applicant, Application Complete, Accepted, or any custom statuses that are set as 'active.' For the FACTS link to display, every kid must be in an Enrollment status with a completed contract, or in an 'inactive' Admissions status. Inactive admissions statuses include: Parent declined Application withdrawn Denied or any custom admissions statuses that are marked as 'inactive.' The FACTS system does not allow for updating data via their integration API once it has been passed over to the FACTS system, so this behavior seeks to reduce the cases where a school has to manually update FACTS because a potential sibling has not yet been moved to Enrollment. -- Using the FACTS Integration After the contract has been submitted, the parent will click the FACTS button on their Enrollment checklist, which brings in their demographic information and tuition/fees data from Finalsite Enrollment into FACTS. The button link provided in the Finalsite Enrollment checklist item is specific to the integration and must be used. Any outside links used by the parent will break the integration. Once in FACTS, the parent/guardian can use their existing username and password to log-in, or create a new account if they are a first time user. The two accounts will then be linked, and Finalsite Enrollment will remember the sign-on so they can access it from the FACTS checklist item. All bank account information etc. that was entered last year in FACTS will remain. The address/name(s) will be updated in FACTS if it\u2019s different on the contract, which usually has a contact update page embedded within. -- How the Integration Works Once logged into FACTS, the tuition and fees will pass over from Finalsite Enrollment to FACTS. Fee examples include: Tuition, Required Fees, Optional Fees, Discounts, Supply Fee, Sibling Discount, Deposit, Scholarship Amounts, and Financial Aid Amounts. NOTE: If you have certain fees that don't need to be passed over to FACTS, this can be set on an individual fee basis. Grades and Fees will be mapped between Finalsite Enrollment and the FACTS institution accounts as part of the integration setup. Balances are passed over per student , not per family. Parents will select their payment plan within FACTS and finalize the agreement. The school will not need to manually finalize agreements. Finalsite Enrollment Checklist Behavior As noted above, if a family has one child in enrollment, and one or more children in an active admissions status such as applicant, application complete or accepted, the FACTS link will not display until the kid(s) in admissions are either moved to an inactive admissions status or into enrollment with completed contracts. In this case, the parent/guardian will see the following message in their checklist: Once all kids are either in enrollment with submitted contracts or those in admissions are set to an inactive status, the FACTS button will display. Below is an example with customized parent explanation text that you can edit within your enrollment checklist settings . We recommend you tell parents/guardians not to log into their FACTS account directly because this will break the integration. Click here to learn how to update the parent explanation text. Parents/guardians will click on the button, which will pass over all tuition and fees one time. Anything that needs to be adjusted after the button is pushed, will need to be updated in FACTS directly. Once the enrollment agreement has been finalized in FACTS and the payment plan has been selected, the Finalsite Enrollment checklist item is marked complete automatically. This allows you to monitor who completed the FACTS process and who did not via a complete/incomplete checklist item search . Mid-Year Enrollment The FACTS system does not support multiple active years. This means, once the FACTS year is rolled-over to a new year, families who are enrolling for the prior year (aka mid-year enrollment) cannot use the integration to pass over fees and set up their account. General Best Practices Customize the parent explanation text of the FACTS Checklist item. For example, 'The FACTS link will be available once all contracts in a family have been submitted. Once that is available, FACTS must be accessed via this link from your Finalsite Enrollment checklist. If FACTS is accessed externally, you will not see your fees in FACTS.\u201d If you make any changes on the FACTS site, please make sure you notify Finalsite Enrollment of these changes, to ensure there are no errors when we push the data over from our system to FACTS. FAQs Errors What does it mean if I see a \"term code error\"? This means FACTS has not enabled the term or the active terms do not match in Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS. What does it mean if I see an \"account code error\"? This means there is a code or codes that do not match in Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS What does it mean if I see a \"grade error\"? This means that the grade doesn't match in FACTS with the way that it's written in Finalsite Enrollment. For example, we may list a grade as \"K\" in Finalsite Enrollment, which is listed as \"Kindergarten\" in FACTS. Parent View and Navigation If parents already have a FACTS account, do they use the same login? Yes! What does the integration look like in Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS? A button will be activated on the student\u2019s checklist within Finalsite Enrollment once all contracts in a family have been completed. This button will allow the family to transfer their fees over to FACTS and complete their agreements. Parents/Guardians MUST click on this button for the integration to work. Once the agreements in FACTS are finalized, the checklist item in Finalsite Enrollment will be marked complete. This checklist item will be searchable so you can track who completed their FACTS agreement and who did not. Scholarship/Financial Aid and Updates Can we make adjustments/credits in special case scenarios? Yes, these can be made in FACTS as an account adjustment if they are not done in Finalsite Enrollment. How do I add financial aid/tuition assistance and/or scholarship amounts into Finalsite Enrollment? If you have this information prior to contract generation, you can create a saved search and bulk update template to fill out the updated amounts and import it back into the system. Click here to learn how. Please note : When adding any new scholarships/aid categories, they need to be set up in both Finalsite Enrollment and FACTS. Whenever adding in new scholarship or aid be sure to communicate the addition on both sides of the integration. What if our school receives financial aid and scholarship amounts later in the process? In this instance, all financial aid and scholarship amounts can be entered manually into FACTS after the parents finalize their agreements. A statement letting families know their total tuition is subject to change may also be added to the agreement. If a contract is submitted, can changes be made that will also reflect in FACTS? If the family has not yet completed their FACTS agreement, the contract can be regenerated in Finalsite Enrollment and resubmitted. The correct amounts will then pass over to FACTS. If the family has already gone over to FACTS and finalized their agreement on the FACTS end, adjustments will need to be made in FACTS. What if a contract is regenerated? If a contract is regenerated and changes are made to fees/tuition, this information will update in FACTS only if the parent hasn\u2019t finalized the FACTS agreement. If they did finalize the agreement in FACTS, the school will need to make updates directly in FACTS in order change any of those fees. General When should the school or parents contact FACTS? If parents have issues logging into FACTS. For example, they may have gone through the checklist, all amounts are correct, but their FACTS log-in doesn't work or exist. If the parent needs split payments, the school will need to connect with FACTS in order to facilitate that. Typically our families use automatic re-enrollment (continuous enrollment) each year in FACTS. What is the difference with the integration? Some schools offer automatic re-enrollment (aka continuous enrollment) and do not require returning families to complete a contract yearly. Schools using continuous enrollment should only use the SSO integration. Please review our FACTS: Unique Workflows article for our recommendations on managing this. What if a family has a returning student and a new student - since returning and new student enrollment is done at different times during the year? This can be an issue because all students in a family must have a signed contract in order for the family to push to FACTS. The FACTS link will not appear for anyone in the family until all active student contracts are signed. You can read more about our recommendations for managing scenarios like these in this article . We have families enrolling multiple kids, how does that work with FACTS? They won\u2019t be able to log into FACTS until all of their children's contracts have been completed. There\u2019s one contract per child, and all need to be completed within Finalsite Enrollment before clicking on the FACTS link within the Enrollment Checklist. What about full-pay students/families? Full-pay students don\u2019t have to go through FACTS if the school has an established process for handling them. What about families that are waiting on a decision for their Applicant student? Can they finalize their FACTS account and payment? No. Schools should instruct returning families who are waiting on a decision for a new student not to finalize their agreement. This is to allow families to have one FACTS agreement for the entire family. Split Family Situations How are split families handled with the integration? In Finalsite Enrollment, we cannot split payments or have multiple contracts. We recommend having a statement within the tuition and fees section of the contract such as \"The totals may not accurately reflect split payment amounts and will be adjusted in FACTS.\" It's possible to add a checkbox for parents to mark that they read and agree to the statement. You will need to handle and adjust the split payments in FACTS for both parents on a case-by-case basis. Since two separate parents are unable to register or enroll through Finalsite Enrollment, there isn't a way for each parent to set up a separate payment plan within Finalsite Enrollment. One parent will need to go through Finalsite Enrollment to complete the process. Once the payment plan has been set up, you can manually adjust that parent's payment plan in FACTS to reduce the amount of tuition and fees that are due. The other option is for you school to manually create an invoice agreement so that the family can log into their online account and convert it to an ACH/CC plan. Both parents log into FACTS with their own account so they can see their own individual payment plan and amounts that are due. Can all parents see the contract? Please note that both parents will be able to see everything (the amounts on the contract and the amounts on the ad-hoc form) if they each have a Parent Portal account in Finalsite Enrollment AND if they both have financial responsibility set to 'yes' within the tied student record. Please note: Only parents/guardians with the financial responsibility toggle enabled can access and complete a student's contract. A parent without this flag enabled will be able to see the contract checklist item but will not be able to access and sign the contract. Click here to learn how to manage financial responsibility.

The subject line of this email will contain the text \" Dispute Updated \" and the body of the email will contain a link to your Disputes page. Both of these emails will be trackable within Finalsite Enrollment under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Sent Emails . Lost Disputes When it comes to financial transactions, disputes are an inevitable occurrence. Whether due to misunderstanding or genuine disagreement, disputes can lead to complications, especially when they result in a loss. Understanding how to manage lost disputes is crucial for maintaining financial integrity and ensuring smooth operations with families Very Important Our team is not able to reverse or modify a Lost dispute. Once a dispute is lost, it becomes irrevocable within Finalsite Enrollment. While you retain the autonomy to manage the dispute with the family's account as you see fit, it's important to note that neither you nor our team can alter the outcome of a lost dispute within our system. Understanding a lost Dispute When a dispute is labeled as \"Lost,\" it signifies that the issuing bank (the parent's bank) has sided with the parent. When a dispute is lost: You will still have access to the data of the dispute on your Disputes page. You will not have access to the 'Counter Dispute' or 'Accept Dispute' buttons. You will still receive an email notifying you of the closure of the dispute. You will see the status of a lost dispute reflected on the Disputes page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Disputes). Here is what that looks like: When you click Show , you will see more details and notes about the dispute, including any submitted evidence. What Happens Next As mentioned in the note at the top of this section, once a dispute is considered \"Lost\", there is nothing that can be done to alter that outcome in Finalsite Enrollment and our team can not affect or change the outcome in any way. Because disputed amounts are not added back to the ledger, it may be necessary to make a manual adjustment to the parent's ledger. Managing Lost Disputes on the Ledger Disputed amounts do not automatically charge back to a payer\u2019s ledger. This means that you may need to take action on the ledger depending on the circumstance. If you still need to charge the parent, add a Reverse Payment to the ledger. When it comes to lost (or accepted) disputes, you take no action on the ledger, the parent will not owe the disputed amount. If you need to charge the parent for the disputed amount, you'll need to add a Reverse Payment to their ledger. How to Reverse a Payment Navigate to the parent\u2019s billing ledger and select the Add Payment button. Description Enter a description to note the reason for the payment reversal. Distribution Select Manual Splits : This is the only option you should select when reversing a payment. Do not select auto-distribute for payment reversals. Category Set the billing category that the payment should be applied to. For payments that comprise of multiple categories, you will need to split the payment so that this negative payment is an exact match for the original one. Amount Add the amount as a negative number. You MUST add the amount as a negative number in order to reverse the original payment. Add Split In order to match the reversal to the exact setup at the original, you will need to match the category split as well. For each split, be sure to add the payment amount as a negative number . Short example video of a Payment Reversal: If you don't need to charge the parent but want a record of the dispute for your reporting, you need to reverse both the payment and the charge . For a guide on Reversing the Payment , see the steps above. Reverse a Charge The Reverse Charge button allows you to reverse individual contract charges. This is useful anytime you need to reverse a contract charge and you don\u2019t want to remove the contract (which deletes all the charges). Reverse Charge is only available for charges added through the contract. You won't see the Reverse Charge icon on manually added charges. If you need to use this option, you can do so along the far right of the charge line item within the ledger. Click on the reverse charge arrow and the credit details window will open with the credit details auto-populated. You can make any changes as needed. Select Preview to review the reversal. Select Previous to go back and make changes. Select Confirm to approve the reversal and add it to the ledger.

    "body": "Overview In some cases, it is necessary to regenerate a contract in order to adjust past charges on a parent/payer's ledger. There are different ways to accomplish this, depending on certain scenarios. This article will outline the different use cases and approaches to contract regeneration for plan adjustment. Use Cases/ Examples Parent signs and submits their contract but later needs to adjust the financial split. A payment plan change is needed on a ledger with multiple payers. Change is necessary on the full payment plan schedule (including past charges). If you only need to make changes to future charges on a ledger, you may opt to use the 'Rearrange Installments' feature. You can read more about it here. Important Points to Consider When you need to adjust past charges , there are two options explained below: Regenerate the contract with the parent's signature. Choose this option If you need a signed contract that matches the payment plan on the ledger. This option will require the parent(s) to re-sign and submit the form. Regenerate and submit the contract internally. Choose this option if you don't need a signed contract that matches the payment plan on the ledger. With internal contract regeneration/submission, you'll still retain a copy of the contract internally, however, the payment plan portion will not match the ledger and the contract will no longer be visible in the Parent Portal. The benefit of internal contract regeneration/submission is that it doesn't require the parent's signature. In other words, the entire process can be managed internally. VERY IMPORTANT: If you are regenerating a contract after the first billing cycle has passed (therefore needing to adjust past charges), you should have a non-cascading payment plan set up prior to regenerating the contract. Having this type of plan set up will adjust the ledger appropriately. For example: If it's currently September and you need to adjust the schedule of a plan that started in July, this would require the setup and use of a non-cascading payment plan. Read more about how to set up a non-cascading payment plan here (scroll to the bottom of the article). Process: Regenerate the contract with the parent's signature First make sure that you have a non-cascading payment plan set up and activated under Settings --&gt; Financial --&gt; Payment Plans. Click here to learn more. Next, regenerate the contract from the edit menu of the student's record. Click here to learn how and view the section titled, 'How-To: Regenerate Contracts.' Process: Regenerate and submit the contract internally. Important: First make sure you have a non-cascading payment plan set up and activated under Settings --&gt; Financial --&gt; Payment Plans. Click here to learn more. On the student's record: 1. Download the contract. Under the 'Form &amp; Document Submission History' section on the lower right side of the record within 'Submitted Forms.' Important: This step is required to maintain a copy of the existing contract so you can reference it in the future. This will open a new browser window with the pdf of the contract. In this window, your browser will give you an option to download the file. Please note, based on your browser, the download button in the pdf might look different. Pro Tip : Rename the file to make it easier to find. 2. Regenerate the student's contract Click on 'Manage Contract' -- 'Regenerate Contract' from the menu on the top right side of the student record. Follow the prompts in the regeneration window and type the word 'Regenerate' on the final page. Then click 'Submit.' To learn more on contract regeneration, click here . Refresh your page to see the contract status updated to 'Generated' 3. Manually check off the contract checklist item. This will display the 'Contract Submission Details' window. Set the ' Receipt date' field at the top for the contract submission date. If you need to include any 'Optional Fees,' be sure to select the checkbox next to the fee. Select the non-cascading plan in the Payment Plans section. Click 'Submit.' 4. On the student's checklist, select 'Upload' on the contract checklist item. This will open your computer's file manager. Here, select the downloaded contract and it will upload into the checklist item. The checklist item will appear the same, except that the ' Upload' link will change to a link that says 'Manage Files.' Your contract will now be listed in the 'Uploaded Documents' section of 'Form &amp; Document Submission History.' The updated payment plan schedule will now be displayed within the parent's/guardian's ledgers as per your selection! Important Things to Remember: The contract will only be visible internally. Parents will no longer see the pdf of the contract within the Parent Portal. The downloaded contract will not match the updated payment plan. If you are utilizing the Ledger Lock feature and a contract is submitted within the locked period, expect the following: Only payment plans that don't have dates within the locked range will appear as options. If selecting a pay-at-once option, the charge will post as due on the 1st billing date after the ledger lock period. You can read more about Ledger Lock in our Settings: Billing Setup Page article.

    "body": "Overview During the Billing Process, Admins may need to modify payment plans post contract submission. The ' Rearrange Installments ' feature allows Admins to customize the payment plan schedule and percentages for your families at any point in the billing process, which includes the option to create a new payment plan for an individual student. This provides more flexibility in the billing process for your families, while minimizing complexity to your existing payment plan setup. This feature is recommended when payment plan adjustments are needed on future scheduled charges. To read how to adjust past charges , please refer to this article. Important Notes About Adjustments This feature applies the adjustment to all payers who have a percentage of financial responsibility for the student the adjustment is being made for. For example, if a student has a financial split between 2 payers, both of the payer's ledgers will reflect the adjustment to the payment plan. Therefore, if the adjustment is only meant to apply to one of the payer's ledgers, it must be made manually rather than through the Rearrange Installments feature. Only upcoming and future charges can be adjusted. Past charges cannot be adjusted within this feature and will display in a read-only view near the top of the details window. Adjustments will NOT be applied to any manual charges. Adjustments will only be made to charges added to the ledger through the contract. -- Process Within the Billing--&gt; Ledger tab of the parent/payer record on the Admin side, you can access the ' Rearrange Installments ' button in the upper right. Once you click on the ' Rearrange Installments ' button, a dialogue box will open with the existing payment plan and details as described below: Affected payers: If there's additional payers assigned to the student, a message will display at the top with a list of all connected billing accounts that will be impacted by the changes made. Billing Contact: Select the billing contact/student that you would like to make payment plan changes for from the drop-down. Number of Payments: Click on the drop-down menu to set the number of payments. Schedule: If there's any past payments, they will display at the top of the schedule section in a read-only format and cannot be changed, as indicated by the grey shading. All upcoming and future payments can be modified as follows: Month: Select each month according to the number of payments set above the schedule. Year: Select the year for each upcoming payment. Percent: Set the percentage for each upcoming payment. Please note, these do not need to be the same each month, however, the total percentage between past and upcoming payments must add up to 100 . Save: Once all adjustments have been made, click the 'Save' button to set them and apply your changes, which will be reflected in the Ledger on both the Admin side and within the parent/payer's ledger within the Parent Portal. Close: This button will NOT automatically save the changes and will only close the dialogue box -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Billing: Payment Plans &amp; Schedules Billing: Fee &amp; Payment FAQs",

    "body": "Overview During the Billing Process, parents can overpay the amount due in their Billing Management tab, however, they can not allocate what fees their payment is applied to. This is dictated by the billing category order and where there's a remaining balance. This article explains the different overpayment scenarios you may come across, and offers guidance should adjustment to an overpayment be necessary. -- Overpayment Scenarios Scenario 1. Overpayment with no future remaining balance When a parent/payer makes a payment in excess of the amount due, and there's no remaining balances, the overpayment may be refunded through the school's payment processor. If your school is using Payments, you can read more about how to process a refund here. Scenario 2. Overpayment with a remaining balance and only one student on the ledger When a parent/payer who has only one student in their Billing Ledger makes a payment in excess of their current balance, the overpaid amount will get assigned to the 'Prepaid' billing category. Once the next billing cycle arrives, the ledger will auto-adjust and disperse the overpaid amount according to the upcoming amount owed on the ledger as well as the order set within the school's billing category page. IMPORTANT: If you need to make adjustments to the allocation of an overpayment, please read how to do so here. Scenario 3. Overpayment with a remaining balance and multiple students on the ledger When a parent/payer with multiple students makes a payment in excess of their current balance, the overpaid amount will get assigned to the 'Prepaid' billing category. Once the next billing cycle arrives, the payment will be evenly distributed across any student balance according to the upcoming amount owed on the ledger as well as the order set within the school's billing category page. IMPORTANT: If you need to make adjustments to the allocation of an overpayment such as redistributing to other students or to different billing categories, please read below: Adjusting a payment to go to a different billing category and/or student When making a ledger adjustment, you should always match the type (charge, credit or payment). Therefore, when re-allocating a payment to a different billing category, you'll be adding a negative payment (to cancel out the original one) followed by a positive payment (to apply the amount to the new category). This can be done all in a single step with a $0 payment entry as seen below. 1. Select the ' Add Payment ' button. 2. Within the ' Payment Details ' window, you'll be asked to fill out the following information: Description: Add a description of the payment adjustment. Distribution &gt; Auto Distribute: In this scenario, leave this box unchecked . Payment Method: Select the Payment Method used in the original payment. Received Date: Enter the date the payment was received. Category &amp; Contact: Select the initial billing category to which the payment was applied and the student/term that the payment applies to. Amount {IMPORTANT}: Enter the amount you are moving as a negative number as shown below. 3. Select the ' Add Split button. ' 4. Within the split section, you'll be asked to fill out the following: Category: Select the billing category that you are moving the payment to. Select the student/term that the payment applies to. Amount - IMPORTANT: Enter the amount you are moving as a positive number as shown below. Important Note : If you are reallocating a payment to a different student, this step is where you'd select the other student's name/term from the dropdown that appears under the category. 5. Set the posting date to ' At once ' and, in the Date box, enter the date of the original payment. 6. Select 'Preview' to view the update in the Payment Details window. If you click on the small triangle to the left of the date, you will see a breakdown of the adjustment. At the bottom of the pop-up, you have the option to select the following: Close - which cancels the adjustment. Previous - which takes you back to the previous screen in the pop-up. Confirm - which closes the box and saves the adjustment to the ledger. Example of the Payment Details window with the triangle expanded, showing the breakdown: 7. Select 'Confirm' to approve the adjustment. The expected ledger view will show a $0 payment as you are simply moving an existing payment from one place to another. It will look something like this: Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Billing Categories Billing: Prepayments Payments: Refunding a Payment",

    "body": "Learn how to use the tools in Finalsite's CMS and EMS systems to nurture and streamline your admissions and enrollment processes. Overview Using Finalsite\u2019s content management system (CMS) in conjunction with Finalsite\u2019s enrollment management system (EMS) provides the optimal experience for parents and school administrators alike. The combination provides you with the tools to streamline the admissions and enrollment process, as well as nurture leads and communicate with your existing families in a more dynamic way. Finalsite\u2019s tools are best when used together, nurturing families at every stage of the family journey can and should involve both platforms. This article will guide you through successfully using both platforms together, including best practices on embedding your inquiry form, when to use EMS forms or CMS forms, and how to integrate the two platforms seamlessly. Terms used in this article For the purpose of streamlining this article you will see two terms used to refer to our two systems CMS (Content Management System) - This refers to Finalsite\u2019s website, marketing and communication tools (known as Finalsite Composer, Messages and Workflows). EMS (Enrollment Management System) - This refers to Finalsite\u2019s admissions, enrollment and tuition management platform. From Prospects to Alumni The CMS and EMS both have features designed to enhance every stage of the family journey: prospect , inquiry , applicant , enrollment , and enrolled . The Prospect Stage The prospect stage begins when a family is first learning about your school, before they\u2019re even ready to provide you with enough information to add them to your EMS. Therefore, it\u2019s a best practice to track and communicate with prospects through your CMS platform using Finalsite Messages and Workflows. Message open and click rates can be tracked in your CMS. This information is essential to determine the success of your marketing efforts. Enable Leadflow to get form information sent from CMS to EMS where Prospects will be created. Read more about that here: Finalsite Leadflow . Prospect forms in your CMS do not require a lot of information. You only have to collect a parent\u2019s name and email to add them to lead-nurturing marketing campaigns . You can also upload contact lists received from outside sources. If you\u2019re ready to move your prospects forward, provide event registration using your EMS inquiry form, and direct all event registration links to that page. If not, you can use CMS forms for event registration . Event registration on the EMS inquiry form automatically creates the contact in your EMS system as an Inquiry. If the contact was a prospect before event registration, they would automatically advance to an Inquiry status upon registration. The Inquiry Stage After you\u2019ve successfully nurtured a prospective family and they\u2019re ready to inquire, you\u2019ll use the EMS inquiry form to collect their information and manage the next stage of the process. At this point, you can take advantage of the EMS + CMS integration to sync family contacts and incorporate both platforms into your communications strategy. You can and should embed your EMS inquiry form onto your CMS website . Completing the inquiry form creates a student record in the EMS system and generates a customized internal-facing checklist for Admins at the school to track their follow-up efforts, event registration and attendance. If you\u2019re using the integration, the contact created by the inquiry form in the EMS system will also be synced in the Constituent Manager of your CMS, complete with their admissions status. Their status will be updated as it changes in the EMS, enabling you to target and even automate CMS communications. Depending on your school\u2019s needs, you may want to focus marketing communication efforts through the CMS or the EMS \u2014 or, even better, both. You can use the EMS communication plan to automate further communication based on selections in the inquiry form, as well as the CMS Workflows module to nurture inquiries into applicants with a series of messages that can be customized according to the contact\u2019s behavior. Even though parent-facing forms aren\u2019t available in the EMS during the inquiry phase outside of the inquiry form itself, you can still collect additional information about these families using CMS Forms. As a best practice, continue to collect registration for admissions events using the EMS inquiry form (embedded in a CMS site page!) or the EMS public calendar link. If you\u2019re hosting an event that is not specifically for applicant families \u2014 such as a community event \u2014 you may want to put this event in the CMS Calendar Manager module to avoid accidentally creating EMS inquiry records for non-applicant families. Any contacts that should not yet be in your Inquiry/Applicant Workflow in your EMS with a checklist of touchpoints or admissions requirements should be managed through your CMS. Applicant Once they\u2019ve learned all about your organization through your beautiful marketing efforts, what family wouldn\u2019t want to apply? Now, make use of all the tailor-made features in the EMS parent portal to guide your families through the application process with ease, while maintaining the connection with the CMS platform for additional benefits. Host the link to your EMS Application on your CMS online application page. This page should have clear instructions, helpful content about the admissions process, and a \u201ccall to action\u201d button , such as \u201cApply Now.\u201d A family can click the link to go to your EMS site, create a portal account, and complete the application. If the family isn\u2019t already in the system as an inquiry, new records will be created and linked in the system for all contacts. If the family did submit an inquiry, the new record will be merged with the existing inquiry, and the child\u2019s status will be updated to applicant in the EMS system. If you\u2019re using the integration, a new contact will be added to your CMS when a new record is created in your EMS through application submission. If an inquiry contact was created previously, the existing record in your CMS will progress to the applicant stage. Communication efforts at the applicant phase should be designed to encourage admissions checklist completion within the parent portal of your EMS. While all admissions task communication for both families and admins should be hosted in your EMS, you can still use your CMS tools to promote events, run acceptance campaigns, and market to your applicant families. Forms at the applicant stage should be hosted on the EMS admissions checklist to provide families with a streamlined hub of information, which makes completion of the application process easier. Event Management Recommendations: Use the EMS admissions checklist to collect registrations for admissions events, but keep non-admissions events separate on the CMS platform to prevent anyone from unintentionally creating an inquiry record. If you are hosting registration for an event in your CMS, hyperlink the registration page in your EMS to drive attendance. The Enrollment Stage Congratulations! You\u2019ve attracted the highest-quality prospects and nurtured them along the path through the inquiry and applicant phases, and now you want them to enroll! Continue using the features in your EMS, which is designed to simplify this process for families, while letting the integration maintain up-to-date records in the CMS. In this stage, communications should be centered around pushing the family to complete the enrollment process \u2014 including deadline and checklist completion reminders \u2014 and hosted primarily in the EMS. Even so, you can still use your CMS to promote events and market to enrolling families. Link dedicated \u2018Accepted Student\u2019 landing pages in your EMS. Use Messages and Workflows to champion your school to accepted students who haven\u2019t yet enrolled fully, edging out competition from other schools. As before, you\u2019ll host enrollment forms and event registrations on the EMS checklist, but use CMS calendars to differentiate non-enrollment events. Enrolled You did it! Students are enrolled, deadlines have passed, and it\u2019s time to relax (or start planning for next year). Once a student becomes actively enrolled at the school, all non-enrollment communication campaigns should take place in your CMS platform utilizing workflows and messages. Family contacts will be managed through your student information system (SIS). Use Messages, Workflows, and Posts with dynamic content for communications for incoming parents. This experience for incoming parents should align with what they will experience once the student starts school. If you have a CMS integration with the EMS and/or SIS, contacts created from the EMS integration in your CMS should be archived or deleted after enrollment, to prevent duplication with the SIS integration. If you don\u2019t have an SIS integration, all enrolled family contacts will need to be imported separately into the CMS. If you\u2019re using the integration, you can either suspend the integration until the next admissions cycle or keep it running for mid-year enrollment efforts.",

This includes: Header and Subheader Text Field Prompts (The questions on your form) Comment Text For more details on edit permissions within the basic form editor vs the advanced form editor, and what changes need to be made by the Support Team, please refer to this article . Who has access to add and edit forms? Types: System Admin and Admins Permissions: Any How to Get Started Pop some Popcorn! If you'd like to watch our video on Basic Form Edits, you can check that out here, in our video library. Go to Settings &gt; Forms and select the Form you'd like to edit. In this example, we're going to edit the Application Form. Navigate to the 'Active' version of your form, which is the one that's currently viewable to families if it's a parent-facing form, or that's active internally such as an Interview Notes form. Next, you'll need to clone the active form so that you have a draft version. Click on 'Select' and choose 'Clone.' Please note, the active version will remain active until you publish a new version. This will create a 'Draft' version of your form. Click on the ' Edit Form ' button to open the Basic Form Editor. In the Basic Form Editor, you will see the 'preview' version of the form, which is the same view that you and your families see. All text areas that can be edited are marked with a dotted underline as shown below. For any edits that you would like to make beyond text changes, you'll need to access the 'Advanced' Form Editor. Now let's explore each content area you can edit and the options that are available. Page Navigation If you're working on a form with multiple pages, you can click on the drop-down and select the page you'd like to edit. Header/Subheader Text Within the form, you have 4 levels of text: Page Name, Section Header, Subsection Header, and Prompts. You can edit the text on all of them but you will not see the Editor Toolbar to make styling edits on the Page Name . Clicking on the text opens the ' Edit Field ' dialogue box. Within here, you can edit the ' Prompt ,' which is the displayed text. You also have the option to click on ' Show Toolbar ' for font styling. (You won't have this toolbar for the Page Name but you should see it when selecting any of the other text). The font toolbar will have all of your typical styling options available. Once you're done editing, click ' Save ' to set your changes. Important Note: Make sure you're consistent with the styling that you use across each content type. Field Prompts All of the questions on your forms are fields within your site. Each field is displayed on the form as a 'Prompt.' The Field ' Prompt ' on the form is the question or information that you're gathering. The prompt is the parent's view of a field name. Sometimes they have the same name, but most often they vary a bit. For example, the 'name' field on your side of the system might say 'Name of Applicant' on the form. And the 'Sports Interests' field name on your side of the system might say 'What are your favorite sports to play?' on the form. Let's edit the field prompt for ' Name of Applicant .' This field also has optional ' explanation ' text that displays directly above the field. The explanation text can be used to explain something important about this question, but it isn't required for any field prompts. Click on the prompt to edit. The ' Edit Field ' dialogue box will open. Here you can use the same font toolbar to style your text if needed. You can edit the prompt and add/change/remove an explanation. Once you're done, click ' Save ' to set your changes. Comment Text Throughout your form, you may have some Comment Text which is standalone text on your form, and is separate from the field explanation text which only displays directly above the field. Comment text can be placed anywhere on your form to describe something or give directions about something. On your Inquiry Form, you may have comment text to describe any events that are hosted on your form. Or in the example below, there's comment text displayed at the top of the Student Questionnaire page of the Application form to explain what information is expected on this page. Click on the text to open the ' Edit Field ' dialogue box. Make any changes you want and then click ' Save ' to set them. Preview and Publish Form Preview Once all text edits have been made, you'll need to preview your form to ensure everything is correct before publishing and making it active. From the 'Actions' menu, click on 'Preview' to view the form as your families would see it or as your internal staff will see it in the case of an internal-facing form. Form Comments Once all changes look good, set some ' Form Comments ' so you can track what changes you made and then click ' Save .' Publish Now that everything is updated and has been tested, it's time to Publish! Click on the 'Actions' menu and select ' Publish (Make Active).' The prior form that was active will now be retired and the new version will now be active to your families or to internal staff if it's an internal facing form.

    "body": "Overview The Revenue Recognition Report gives schools the ability to see what you booked for the year with some custom set parameters, and when you expect to receive it. Recognition Period Setup To configure a global recognition period, you can do so within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup . This will act as a default for all of your Billing Categories. However, if you need to define different recognition periods or allocation rules per billing category, you can do so within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories. Click here to learn how to define the global parameters within your Billing Setup page. Revenue Recognition Report Recognition Parameters Within the report, you can filter down on what revenue you want to view with different types of parameters. Billed: The timeframe of when the charges have been added to the ledger. Recognized up to: The timeframe that determines what or what hasn\u2019t been recognized. This correlates to the allocation rules set up in your ' Settings--&gt;Financial--&gt;Billing Categories' as well as the rules set within ' Settings--&gt;Billing Setup--&gt;Revenue Recognition.' Report Details The report will display the revenue details for all months within the timeframe set at the top. If you click on each month within the report, it will expand to display the revenue recognized by billing category for each month according to the allocation rules. Along the far right is the 'recognized up to' month, which displays the total amount recognized across all months set, and any remaining revenue, or unrecognized amounts for that month. Export to .CSV For additional reporting needs, you can export the data to .CSV in the upper right. Important Notes: This report does not necessarily coincide with payments.

    "body": "Overview Event Management is a key piece of your lead nurturing and relationship building with prospects and current applicants/students. This article will explain what platform to use for event registration, with some best practice recommendations and possible roadblocks. Terms Used in This Article You will see the following terms used to refer to Finalsite\u2019s two systems: CMS (Content Management System) refers to Finalsite\u2019s website, marketing, and communication tools (which includes Forms, Composer, Messages, and Automated Email Workflows). EMS (Enrollment Management System) refers to Finalsite\u2019s admissions and enrollment platform (formerly SchoolAdmin). Best Practices All events for admissions and enrollment should be hosted in your EMS platform. Provide event registration for prospective families on the EMS Inquiry form and host/embed the form on your CMS site. Provide targeted registration for admissions/enrollment events after the Inquiry stage on your EMS checklist. Link all event information in your CMS to the EMS Portal. Community events (i.e. events that are not specific to student enrollment such as Grandparent\u2019s Day) should be hosted in your CMS platform Questions to Consider Is event registration required of an applicant in order to be accepted or become enrolled? If yes, this item belongs on your EMS checklist and should be hosted there. You can still promote your event on your CMS webpage and hyperlink to the EMS portal for registration. Does event registration trigger an Admissions/Enrollment Checklist item or internal reminder? If yes, event registration should be hosted in your EMS platform or on your EMS Inquiry Form embedded on a page in your CMS site. Who needs access to the registrant list? Are they an Admin/User/Reviewer in the intended platform? While admissions and enrollment events should be hosted on the EMS checklist and inquiry form, do you have any events that would be hosted by another party? Example: Your soccer coach would like to host an interest day and gather T-shirt sizes of attendees. This type of event is not considered a requirement and your coach will likely not have Admin access in the EMS platform. Event registration should then take place on a form in your CMS platform. Would you like to collect a fee upon registration? This is only available in EMS at the Admissions and Enrollment stages. Key Features/Benefits of CMS and EMS Registration Setup Feature CMS EMS Notes Custom appointment/event registration form YES YES Build a custom form with additional fields such as T-shirt size. Collect fee with form submission YES YES (Applicant --&gt; Enrollment only) In EMS this is only available at the applicant stage and beyond Automatically close event registration YES YES Use Scheduled Activation in CMS forms to stop receiving form submissions. Set a custom attendee cap per event date YES Automate custom follow up communications upon registration YES YES Custom name tag generation YES Parent Workflow Feature CMS EMS Notes Only name and email required for event registration YES EMS requires additional contact information, including phone number and address. Non-admissions/enrollment event registration YES EMS events are only intended for prospective/current student events. They are not intended for community events Allowing a parent to cancel or reschedule YES Parent cancellation and rescheduling is optional per event in your EMS.

    "body": "Overview Using Finalsite\u2019s Content Management System (CMS) with our Enrollment Management System (EMS) provides the optimal experience for parents and school administrators alike. This combination gives you the tools to streamline communications, nurture leads, and obtain mission-fit students in a more dynamic way. In this article, you'll learn the benefits and important points to consider when managing communications across both the CMS and EMS platforms. Terms Used in This Article You will see the following terms used to refer to Finalsite\u2019s two systems: CMS (Content Management System) refers to Finalsite\u2019s website, marketing, and communication tools (which includes Forms, Composer, Messages, and Automated Email Workflows). EMS (Enrollment Management System) refers to Finalsite\u2019s admissions and enrollment platform (formerly SchoolAdmin). Best Practices Create a journey map to outline all touchpoints from prospective student to fully enrolled student, to prevent duplicate communication between the CMS and EMS systems. Use all communication tools to nurture and improve your yield as well as aid your retention efforts. Utilize the integration of your CMS platform to target communications to the appropriate recipient with up-to-date statuses. Use Workflows and Messages in your CMS to nurture leads, encourage prospective students to apply, and enroll accepted students. All admissions and enrollment communications intended to drive action on an EMS checklist item should be sent from your EMS system and contain a link to the EMS parent portal. Questions to Consider Is the communication a call to action on the Admissions/Enrollment checklist (for example, a checklist reminder, form link, etc.)? If so, it is best practice to send the communication through your EMS. Are you still competing with other schools? While all admissions/enrollment task communication should be hosted in your EMS, you can use your Finalsite CMS to promote events and market to incoming families. Messages and Workflows can help convert students who have been accepted but have not yet enrolled.

EMS (Enrollment Management System) refers to Finalsite\u2019s admissions and enrollment platform (formerly SchoolAdmin). Best Practices Enable the Finalsite Leadflow feature to use data from forms created in CMS to automatically create Lead and Prospect records in EMS. Then, market to the prospective families, encouraging them to inquire or apply. You can learn more about this in our article: Finalsite Leadflow . Use forms in your EMS for admissions- and enrollment-related items. The EMS inquiry form should be embedded on your CMS site for easy access and to create an Inquiry record in your EMS system. Place a link to your EMS application form on your CMS site with a call to action. Questions to Consider Do you need to collect a fee upon form submission? Fee collection is not available in your EMS until after the applicant phase. All fee collection prior to the student becoming an applicant will need to take place in your CMS site. Does the collected information tie to a contract fee, or trigger an Admissions/Enrollment Checklist item or internal reminder? If so, this form should be hosted in your EMS. Who needs access to the collected data? Are they an admin, user, or reviewer in the intended platform? Each platform has a unique set of users. While all admissions and enrollment forms should be collected in EMS and visible to all of your admissions and enrollment staff, you may need other information collected for a different audience. For example, a coach or teacher may like to collect T-shirt orders with a sporting event form. The coach is likely not an EMS user, and this is not related to admissions or enrollment. In that case, the form should be hosted in your CMS. What stage in the admissions cycle will the parent/student be presented with this form? Prospects do not have access to complete forms outside of the inquiry form itself in the EMS platform. Would you like to auto-import form data from CMS to automatically create Lead and Prospect records in EMS? If so, you'll need to start by reaching out to support in order to enable the Leadflow feature within your EMS site. Then, you'll be able to set up CMS forms to send parent and student data over to your EMS site where they will be automatically created as Leads (parents) and Prospects (Students). You can learn more about Leadflow Forms in this article: Finalsite Leadflow . Will you manually import data collected on a CMS form into your EMS? If you're planning to use contact information collected with a form from the Finalsite CMS within the EMS, it's important to note that the EMS requires certain pieces of information to create a new prospect. To successfully import the data into EMS, make sure that you collect the following on your CMS form: prospect_entry_grade prospect_entry_year Note: Student email (on the Prospect Import Template as CHILD.email) is only required if you do not have parent contact information on the import file. You must have one or the other to import the prospects into the EMS. Key Features and Benefits of CMS and EMS Workflows Feature CMS EMS Notes Prospect form(s) YES Forms in your EMS are only available from Inquiry--&gt; Enrollment but you can enable Leadflow within your CMS prospects forms to auto-create Leads and Prospects in EMS. Embeddable forms YES YES (Inquiry Form only) Custom appointment forms YES YES Inquiry, Application and Enrollment contract/forms YES Ad-hoc admissions and enrollment forms YES Event registration hosted on forms YES YES EMS forms are intended for admissions and enrollment events only.

    "body": "Overview In today's competitive admissions landscape, your inquiry form is often the first impression a prospective family has of your school. It's not just a simple data collection tool; it's a crucial opportunity to engage families, capture essential information, and guide them seamlessly through the admissions funnel. This article explores best practices for building effective inquiry forms, ensuring your form serves as a welcoming gateway to your school. In this article Basic Components of a Good Inquiry Form Call to Action Info about the Family Interests How did you hear about us? How to make your Inquiry Form really shine Dynamic Questions Event Sign-Ups Financial Aid Minimize Open Text Fields Form Length Basic Components of a Good Inquiry Form Call to Action Begin your inquiry form with clear and concise calls to action. These should immediately communicate the available options to prospective families, such as \"Inquire Now,\" \"Schedule a Tour,\" or \"Learn More About Financial Aid.\" Prominent placement at the top of the form ensures users can quickly identify their next step and encourages immediate engagement. Info about the Family In this section, you'll collect the basic information you need in order to stay connected with the famliy throughout the process. We recommend keeping this section brief and only collecting necessary info from your prospective families. There are, however, certain types of information that is required as part of the form. What am I required to include in the Inquiry form? We require some basic information be collected: Student name Apply Grade Apply Term 1 Parent name/contact info 1 Household address Apart from what's required some schools also ask for the following info from families in this section: Current Grade Current School Parent Relationship Interests Some schools like to collect interests as well. Collecting interests info can be a good way to plan communication from your team. For example, if a student selects that they are interested in Tennis, you could have: An automated reminder set up to internally let the Tennis Coach know that an inquiring student is interested in Tennis. An automatic communication sent to the family including more information about your Tennis program. How did you hear about us? It's a great idea to close out your form with a 'How did you hear about us?' section. This allows you to gather marketing feedback so that you can better understand which channels drive the most prospective families to you. How to make your Inquiry Form Really Shine Make the most of the Call to Action section by including the following Dynamic Questions Within your Inquiry, you can implement dynamic questions that appear or disappear based on previous responses. This creates a personalized experience, avoids overwhelming users with irrelevant fields, and streamlines the data collection process. A good use of this is in your Call to Action section at the top of your form. For example, if a family selects that they would like to ask question, you can open a text box allowing them to enter their queries. Or, if a family expresses interest in touring the school, you can set the form to then reveal the tour sign up component. Event Sign-Ups It's a good practice to integrate event sign-ups directly into the inquiry form! This is also something that's a great fit for the Call to Action section at the top of the form. For example, when a family expresses interest in touring or attending an open house, you can allow them to schedule it right then and there within the Inquiry form by attaching the calendar to the form. Make the sign up even better Make it dynamic by only showing the sign up section for the event if the family selects that option in the Call to Action section of your form. Include clear information about what the event entails. Keep your Finalsite Enrollment Calendar for the event up to date and if you are no longer hosting a specific event, be sure to remove it from the form! Resource If you are looking for information on how to add a calendar to a form, look no further than our Forms DIY: Add a calendar to a form article! Financial Aid Including a Financial Aid interest option in your Call to Action section allows you to provide a clear pathway for families to express interest in receiving aid and request more information. You can use that info internally trigger internal follow-up tasks for your team or automated communication plans to send families more information about the assistance opportunities at your school. Other Best Practices to Optimize you Inquiry Minimize Open Text Fields As a best practice, try not to use open text fields when asking for info on Inquiry forms. Open text answers can make it difficult for you to search for and report on data later on. Let's talk through a simple example to learn how impactful this can be. Let's say for your \"How did you hear about us?\" section you provide an open text box to allow families to type in any answer. Six months later, when the marketing team is pulling together feedback on the channels that are bringing families to your school, they find hundreds of differently worded responses making it time consuming and inefficient to parse through the data. Instead, if you were to set up the \"How did you hear about us?\" section to be a dropdown with a set options list, the reporting aspect later on will be much easier and more impactful for your school. That's a very simple example of the why behind this practice but we encourage you to use it to evaluate your current processes. Should any of your existing text fields be converted to dropdowns for better reporting in the future? Form Length It's recommended to keep your Inquiry form short and sweet. Keeping your form concise by only asking for essential information will encourage higher completion rates from families. Consider the basics that you must know at this stage to keep connected with the families and only ask for what you really need at this stage.

    "body": "Build great relationships through an Inquiry process that\u2026 Analyzes the profiles of your candidates Suggests appropriate individual follow-up Communicates highly targeted messages Having a great Inquiry process provides a positive experience for families and drives deeper engagement. Additionally, by using dynamic checklists, list filters, and bulk communication tools, you can remove much of the burden of the process while maintaining a personalized, high-touch service. Comparing data across Finalsite Enrollment clients shows the benefits of the Inquiry process. On average, schools report an 18% increase in Inquiries in the first year of Finalsite Enrollment compared to before using Finalsite Enrollment. They have a corresponding increase of 13% in the number of Applications . Getting Inquiries is helped by thoughtful marketing strategies. Website design and easy access to the form play a key role. However, the inquiry form design and the communication plan matter greatly in encouraging engagement and converting inquiries into completed applications. Let\u2019s look at some additional numbers: Inquiries convert into an applicant 54.5% of the time on average. Inquiries that book an appointment during the process become applicants 60.1% of the time. Schools collect hundreds, sometimes thousands, of inquiries each year, so a conversation rate improvement at the top of the application funnel has huge implications further down the funnel. It becomes even more apparent how the inquiry process improves family engagement when looking at parents who inquired prior to applying and those who did not. Parents who did not inquire prior submitting an application only completed the application process 81.1%. Parents completed the inquiry process prior to applying completed the application process 89.8% of the time. A completed application process means receiving the initial application and all the subsequent steps schools require including interviews, transcripts, and recommendations forms. What this data tells us is that parents who have gone through the Finalsite Enrollment inquiry process outlined below have built a stronger bond with your school and are invested in the process.

    "body": "Overview Application Forms can be filled out for a family internally by an Admin, which is useful for two cases: If a parent is unable to submit an online application form, you can copy the information from a paper application form to the online format. You can also fill out an application form online while talking to a parent on the phone or for a family without computer/internet access. How-To: Complete an Application as an Admin To access the application form as an admin, use the Quick Action Menu , indicated by the plus sign in the upper right corner of your site. Then, select the 'Fill out an application form' option from the list. This will bring you to the currently active version of your application form. It will work the same way as the one that the parent fills out, except for the following: There is no thank you page at the end The automated thank you email will not go out to the parent Most fields that are marked as required for parents are not required for admins to complete in order to submit the form After you have entered the information you need and imported the form into the system, you will want to send the parent an authentication link for the Parent Portal. They will need to create a Parent Portal Account and authenticate in order to access their student's admissions checklist. To learn more about authentication codes, click here . Save &amp; Finish Later When filling out an application as an admin, you can still use the 'Save &amp; Finish Later' button at the bottom of any page to save the form for later completion. If you use this option, you can return to the application in progress at any time by going to Forms Inbox - Draft Applications , and then clicking 'Entered by: Admins'.

    "body": "Overview The Inquiry Checklist is a powerful internal* tool for managing outreach to prospective students. *Reminder: Because Parent Portal accounts aren't created until the application stage, parents don't see this internal checklist. It's an internal-only tool that you can use to bolster your nurturing efforts. In this article Tailoring Your Outreach Plan with Dynamic Checklist Items Grade-Specific Criteria Custom Rules (with Finalsite Enrollment Support) Example Dynamic Checklist Items Best Practices for Inquiry Checklists Key Inquiry Nurturing Toolkit Tailoring Your Outreach Plan with Dynamic Checklist Items One of the superpowers of the Inquiry checklist lies in its flexibility to dynamically adapt on a student-by-student basis. You can set up the Inquiry Checklist so that the items that appear for each student are relevant to their specific needs and interests. The same applies to your Admissions and Enrollment checklists. They can be tailored to meet your needs in the same way! Here are a couple of ways that you can utilize this capability: Grade-Specific Criteria Within Checklist Settings, you can define the criteria for checklist items based on the student's intended grade level. This ensures you're sharing age-appropriate information and experiences. For example, if you have a Shadow Day event that's specific to 1st-5th grades, you can set a rule on your checklist item to only show this nurturing step for students who've expressed interest in one of those grades. How to Open Settings &gt; Checklist &gt; Inquiry Select Edit next to the item that you'd like to set to show for a specific grade group. In the Criteria section, select the grades that you want the checklist item to appear for. Select Submit to save. Result: Only students who inquire for one of the grades you selected will have that checklist item appear in their (internal) Inquiry checklist. Custom Rules (with Finalsite Enrollment Support) Other than the student's grade, there may be other criteria like you'd like to show/hide a checklist item based on. For example, if you need to check that a specific Viewbook goes out to your International Inquiries, you'd need to utilize the \"Business Rule\" section of the checklist item settings to accomplish that. This feature is locked on your end. (You will see it greyed out.) Our Support team can help you configure rules that trigger specific checklist items based on student demographics, program interests, or other criteria. Just reach out and let us know who you need to siphon that item to show for and we'll make it happen. Keep in mind Of course, setting up a rule to show one of your checklist items based on information about the student depends on whether or not you have already collected that information about the student in the first place. For example, if you haven't yet asked the students within the Inquiry form whether or not they are internationally based, then you wouldn't be able to set a checklist item to show based on whether or not they are international students. So, just keep in mind, you are limited to the information you are collecting. Just take a look at your Inquiry form. If you are asking about it there, you can most likely set up a rule on a checklist item based on it. Example Dynamic Checklist Items Here are some common examples of checklist items that can be set up to internally tailor your connections with families. Respond via Phone or Email to Parent Inquiry Question You can include a question in your inquiry form that asks parents if they prefer for you to reach back out to them via phone or email. Then, within your Inquiry checklist, you can add a checklist item for both scenarios, and our Support team can add a rule to the items so that, based on which selection a parent made in the form, the corresponding checklist item will appear in the internal inquiry checklist. Send \u201cAffording Our School\u201d Email Including a request for information about Financial Aid is a common addition to the call to action section of your inquiry form. Make the most of this request by setting up a checklist item and having our Support team include a rule that tells the item to only show up if the family has requested information about your aid options. Send STEM Packet You may also be asking for specific student interests within your inquiry form . If so, you can make the most of this by setting up a checklist item specific to the student's interest. For example, let's say you include STEM in the list of academic interests you ask families about in the Inquiry form. If a family were to select STEM, set up an inquiry checklist item and have our team add a rule to make the item show up based on this selection. Schedule Campus Tour Connecting calendars to your inquiry checklist is crucial. Any event sign-up that you are adding to your Inquiry form should be included in your internal Inquiry checklist so that you can easily view and manage the student's sign-up on your end right from the checklist. Read about that here: Linking Calendars to Checklist Items Send Welcome Video from Admissions Director Using the checklist as a reminder to complete essential nurturing tasks that aren't automated is a great way to keep your workflow efficient. For example, if you need to track sending a warm welcome video from your admissions director to prospective families, use the inquiry checklist to make sure that this step is not missed. Follow-Up After Open House On a similar note, if you want to make sure that you are following up with families after an event like an open house, include that as an action step on your Inquiry checklist to help remind you to follow up. Taking it further Take your inquiry workflow to the next level by combining the power of the Inquiry checklist with our Automated Communication Plan feature. These Automated Communication Plans allow you to automate the sending of emails or internal reminders based on criteria like the student entering a status or a checklist item being completed. Read about utilizing these more in our Inquiry &amp; Admissions Automated Communication Plans (ACPs) article. Best Practices for Inquiry Checklists Here are our recommended best practices to keep in mind when setting up your inquiry checklist: Detailed Item Names Be specific and descriptive when naming your checklist items. Instead of \"Tour,\" use \"Invite to Lower School Campus Tour.\" This clarity makes reporting and tracking much easier. You'll quickly understand which actions have been completed and which haven't, preventing confusion and ensuring follow-through. Events in the Checklist Link calendar events to invitation or event-related checklist items to streamline scheduling. When speaking with a family, you'll have a \"Schedule Appointment\" option directly within the checklist item. Select an available time slot, and the system can automatically send confirmation and reminder emails to the family based on your calendar settings. Read about that here: Linking Calendars to Checklist Items Internal Communication Mapping Map out the communication workflow that your families will be part of and make sure your whole team is aware of which communications go out and when they go out across all departments. This will help you be clear and prevent overlapping and overwhelming prospective families with too many communications at once. Focus on Touchpoints Design your checklist to include all the key touchpoints you want to make with prospective families to encourage them to apply. Did you know? You can use Granular Permissions to hide checklist data based on the permission level of the individual user. Adding these permissions allows you to control who can see/edit/view the item and the data related to the item. To learn more about Granular Permissions, please refer to our Granular Permissions for Email and Checklists article. Key Inquiry Nurturing Toolkit As you build out your inquiry checklist and consider your overall inquiry workflow, keep the following points in mind. Inquiry Checklists are Internal Only The Inquiry Checklist is exclusively for internal team use. Parents do not have access to it. Inquiry Form Checklist Item The \"Inquiry Form\" checklist item automatically brings the submitted form into the checklist for easy viewing. User Notifications Set up email notifications for new inquiries in your user settings to stay informed of new submissions. Alternatively, rely on the Admissions &gt; Inquiries tab for a less cluttered inbox. Viewing Past Forms While the current year's forms are visible in the checklist, past years' forms and file uploads can be found in the Form and Document Submission history section of the contact record. Creating Inquiries Internally You can manually create inquiries within EMS using the \"+\" quick action menu . Note that the thank you landing page and automated inquiry thank you email are not triggered when creating inquiries this way (though event emails are still sent). Managing Event Attendance You can mark event attendance directly on the checklist or in bulk using registration reports and saved searches. Bulk Actions Use saved searches and filters to identify groups of inquiries based on checklist item completion or other criteria, and then perform bulk actions like sending emails. Rule-Based Items Use rules to dynamically add checklist items based on student responses on the inquiry form. This ensures targeted follow-up. (Remember, our team can help you add \"business rules\" on our end.) Communication Plans Leverage communication plans to automate outreach based on inquiry status or checklist item completion. Be mindful of email timing to avoid overwhelming families with too many messages at once. Communication plans are stage-specific (inquiry vs. application), so plan accordingly. By mastering the Inquiry Checklist and following these best practices, you can transform your outreach process, build stronger relationships with prospective students, and ultimately drive enrollment success.

    "body": "Overview Inquiry Forms can be filled out by members of your internal team in Finalsite Enrollment. This is particularly helpful if you receive a phone call from a parent or you meet a family in person who has an interest in your school, and you want to make sure they are logged in the Finalsite Enrollment system as an Inquiry. How-To: Fill Out an Inquiry Form via Quick Action Inquiries can be added using the Quick Action menu, indicated by the plus sign (+) in the upper right of your Finalsite Enrollment site. Click on it, and then select 'Fill out an inquiry form.' This will work the same way as the inquiry form that the parent fills out, except for the following: There is no inquiry thank you page at the end. There is no automated inquiry thank you email that goes out to the parent. Most fields that are marked as required for parents to complete are not required for internal users in order to submit the form. Only basic information, such as student name, grade, and term, as well as parent name, is required. If you want to submit inquiry forms for additional siblings after completing the initial inquiry, you can click the grey 'Submit &amp; Start Another' button - instead of the regular 'Submit' button - in the bottom right of the page. This will submit the inquiry form you're currently on, and then open a new inquiry form for you to fill out with all PARENT1-4 or HOUSEHOLD1-2 fields pre-populated from the previous submission.

    "body": "Overview Prospects are students or families that haven't expressed interest in your school yet but who are potential candidates for your funnel. They might be generated from sources such as feeder schools, nearby churches or clubs, referrals from current families, and so on. This is different from an Inquiry , who already expressed some level of interest in your school. Prospects have the potential to be converted into Inquiries or even Applicants for your school. Managing your Prospects in Finalsite Enrollment will help with this goal by allowing you to easily track and communicate with them. Click here to learn about the actions you can take on the Prospects List Page, as well as how to create a prospect report. In the Article Prospect Workflow Important Note on Merging Prospects Adding Prospects in Finalsite Enrollment Individual Add Bulk Add (Import) Automatic Prospects (only for CMS/EMS schools with Leadflow Forms enabled) Add Related Contacts to a Prospect Prospect Workflow Prospects are considered out of workflow contacts in Finalsite Enrollment since they fall outside of your Admissions funnel until you make that first connection. Your first engagement with a prospective family is what converts them to an Inquiry, which is the entry point to your Admissions Funnel AND the start of your relationship! Inquiries are considered in workflow which means you now have a dynamic checklist to track your touchpoints and work on those applicant conversions. Important Note on Merging Prospects Prospects are not assigned an active term in the system when added. Instead, there's an expected entry year field (prospect_entry_year) that is set for them. If a Prospect gets merged with any other contact, or with a contact from a historical import (who also have no active terms in the system), they will be assigned the current active term upon import. Adding Prospects in Finalsite Enrollment You can add Prospects in your Finalsite Enrollment system one at a time, through a bulk import, and/or automatically with Leadflow Forms. Read on below to see instructions on how to do both of these. Individual Add To add an individual Prospect, click on the Quick Action icon (represented by a plus sign) in the upper right of Finalsite Enrollment. Then, select the option for Add a Prospect or Consultant . In the window that appears, enter the first name and last name of the prospect, then press enter on your keyboard. This will search the system for any existing contacts with that name. If the system finds any potential duplicates, you will have the option to update the existing contact(s) or create a new contact. If no potential duplicate matches are found, or you choose to create a new contact, you will then need to select the Contact Role of Prospect. You can then enter their expected Entry Grade and Entry Year, as well as a phone number. After the information has been entered, click on Add Contact . A message will appear at the top of the page informing you that the prospect has been created, with a link to view the prospect's contact record. Bulk Add (Import) If you have a longer list of Prospect to add to the Finalsite Enrollment system, it can be faster add them in bulk by using the Import Data Tool. Click here to learn how to import data in Finalsite Enrollment - a Prospect Import Template is also included in this article under the Create New Contacts section. Automatic Prospects (only for CMS/EMS schools with Leadflow Forms enabled) Important This is only available to those who have CMS and have Finalsite Leadflow enabled in their EMS and CMS sites. If you have CMS and would like to enable this, please contact support . You can read more about this here, in the article: Finalsite Leadflow . Leads generated from a composer form on your school's website (CMS) can be converted into Leads and Prospects on the EMS side. Once you've enabled this feature and set one of your forms in Composer to map data into Finalsite Enrollment, whenever that form is completed, some of the data within the form will be transferred to Finalsite Enrollment (EMS) where it will automatically create parent and (if possible) student records (the students are created as Prospects). Please contact support to enable this feature. Please check out this article for more in-depth info on this: Finalsite Leadflow . Add Related Contacts to a Prospect After adding a new Prospect, you can connect their record to any siblings or parents that are already in your funnel. This information will help your outreach to the Prospect, once you know there has already been a relationship established with the family. Click here to learn how to add related contacts.

    "body": "Overview The Forms Inbox contains recently submitted forms that aren't yet imported into your site. Any form held in the inbox needs to be manually imported by you so that any potential duplicate information is imported correctly. You can access the forms inbox from the Username menu by selecting the Forms to Import option. In this article What's the import process like? Auto-Import Options Forms Notification List Page Columns and Actions Edit Menu How to Import a Form and Merge Contacts/Households Overview and Match Scores Contact Matching Term Conflict Duplicate Appointment Bookings What's the import process like? When importing forms into your site, you'll be asked to review and confirm or deny contact and household matches during this process. A few reasons for imports include: A parent/guardian filled out an inquiry form and then filled out an application form. A parent/guardian filled out an inquiry form or application form more than once. You're using public calendars, which creates each registration as a new inquiry in the system. Families with multiple kids that are applying will have some duplicate contacts and households listed on the forms. Auto-Import Options Within Settings &gt; Basic Setup , you have 2 options to auto-import certain forms. Auto-Import Inquires &amp; Applications: This option will automatically import any new contacts and households for submitted inquiry and application forms into the system that don't have any potential duplicates. Auto-Merge Forms with Strong Matches: This option will automatically merge ' herculean ' and ' strong ' contact and household matches from submitted inquiry and application forms. Medium and weak matches will still require review and manual import. Please refer to the match score chart further down in this article. Important Caution about Merging Prospects or Historical Contacts Prospects and historical contacts aren't assigned an active term in the system when added. Instead, there's an ' expected entry year ' field that's set for Prospects and there's no active term id set for historical contacts that are imported. If one of these contact types is merged with another record that's similar or with an ' in workflow ' contact (Inquiry, Applicant or Enrollment), they will be assigned the current active term upon import. Forms Notification Once an inquiry or application form has been submitted, and is pending review as per the reasons listed above, you will be notified by the number in red located in the upper right of your site on your username. You can view all forms that require an import either by clicking on your Username &gt; Forms to Import , or you can access this page manually by clicking on the Admissions &gt; Forms . Within this tab, you have an Inbox that shows any forms that require a manual import. List Page Columns and Actions Within this page you can see the following columns: Name on form: The name of the child that\u2019s inquiring about your school or applying to your school. Form Type: Indicates if it\u2019s an Inquiry form or Application form. Source: Indicates the source of the application or inquiry. Sources include: Admin entered: The form was submitted by an admin. Online Inquiry: The form came from someone filling out your Inquiry form online. Online Application: The form came from someone filling out your Application online. SSATB: The form came from an SSATB application. (Only for schools with SAO .) Explore Inquiry: The form came from someone inquiring in Finalsite Explore. (Only shows for schools using Finalsite Explore .) Explore Applicant: The form came from someone applying in Finalsite Explore. (Only shows for schools using Finalsite Explore. ) Submission Date: The date the form was submitted. Apply Grade: The apply grade of the kid. Apply Year: The year the kid wants to apply to or is applying to. Action: Click on import along the far right to start the duplicate match check and import the form. Edit Menu If you need to delete an inquiry or application form, mark the checkbox of the inquiry/applicant and then click on the edit menu in the upper right and select delete form(s). How to Import a Form and Merge Contacts/Households Overview and Match Scores Start by clicking the Import link on the right side of the page. Upon clicking on the import button on the far right of a contact, you will see all possible contact/household matches in the system, along with a match score. The higher the match score, the more likely the contacts/households are a match. Refer to the match strength chart below: 0-124: unknown (very unlikely a match) 125-149: weak match 150-224: medium match 225-300: strong match (likely the contacts are a match) 301 and above: herculean match (extremely likely the contacts are a match) Contact Matching You'll see a few key pieces of information to compare the contacts side by side such as status, grade level, term, and related contacts. You can either create a new contact if it's not a match or merge with an existing contact that's displayed. When you click on the ' merge with this contact ' button, you'll see an explanation of what happens when contact records are merged. Review these important points. To confirm the merge, click on the ' next ' button. If the system detects a duplicate with a parent or a duplicate household address, then you'll be asked to merge this contact or household as well. Once all contacts/households have been merged or denied, the form will move from the inbox to the ' recently imported ' forms page. Example Parent Match: Example Address Match: Term Conflict In some cases, you may have a term conflict with your selected merge, where merging the records could advance the term of the existing contact in the database. You will be shown explanations of what happens if you move the contact to the next term or keep them in the current term. Further down in this screen is some additional information on what changing the term affects. If you merge the contacts, then the form will be imported and the records will be merged and updated with information from the form. The form will move from the inbox to the ' recently imported ' forms page. Duplicate Appointment Bookings When importing forms into your site , you'll be asked to review and confirm (or deny) any potential duplicates that the site suspects are present. As part of this process, if the family submitting the form has signed up for an event more than once, we'll alert you. If duplicate bookings are detected, you'll see a page within the import form pop-up that alerts you to the fact that we found multiple bookings. You don't have to take action on that page. (You can import the form without doing anything about the duplicate booking.) Or, if needed, you have the option to cancel one or more of the appointments right from that window by clicking Cancel. See it in Action What happens if you click cancel? If you click Cancel, you'll be asked to confirm whether or not you really intend to cancel the appointment. If you click yes , that specific event booking will be removed from the calendar and student checklist. If you click no , the event will remain booked, and you'll see it listed as it was before, with the option to Cancel it.

    "body": "Overview To better organize your calendars, you can create a variety of Schedules to categorize them. Schedules help you fine-tune the organization of your calendars and you can show or hide them from your view. You may want to set up and use Schedules if: You have a tour with two or three different people hosting and need to internally distinguish between schedules for each person. You have several different hosts for video meetings and would like each to have a unique video conferencing link. You need to distinguish between different school levels for an interview. Good to know Schedules are internal-facing only! Parents won't see the color or name of the schedule on their end. Video Conference Note: If you add custom virtual conferencing links in each schedule, the parents will receive the specific link attached to their schedule. How-To: Create &amp; Manage Schedules Creating New Schedules To create a schedule, navigate to Scheduling -&gt; Calendars and select the desired calendar from the list. Once on the page for that calendar, click on the plus sign next to Schedules along the left sidebar. This will open the Schedule Details window. On the Schedule Details window, you will enter the following information. Name of the Schedule you wish to add. Background color to distinguish the schedule from any others you have set up. (OPTIONAL) Video Conferencing Link*: You can choose to add a unique video conferencing link for anyone that books an appointment from that schedule. To pull this link into the calendar confirmation/reminder email, add this merge token: {{appointment.video_conferencing_link}} (OPTIONAL) Custom Appointment Text*: You can also choose to add custom appointment text for anyone that books an appointment from that schedule. To pull this text into the calendar confirmation/reminder email, add this merge token: {{appointment.custom_schedule_text}}. Please note: HTML and Liquid formatting are not supported in the Custom Appointment Text; however, line breaks will be preserved. Don't forget to click the blue Submit button to save your changes! * Families can always view the Video Conferencing Link and Custom Appointment Text by clicking the View Appointment button next to the calendar item on the student's checklist. To learn more about how to integrate links/custom text into the event confirmation and reminder emails that send to parents, refer to our article on Integrating Virtual Events with Calendar &amp; Emails. Now that you have created your new Schedule, once you click to add or edit a time slot on that calendar, you can select the Schedule you created from the drop-down menu in the Available Time Details window. Click Submit to save your changes on this window. Appointment slots will now show up on the calendar in the colors you assigned to each schedule. If you want to hide one or more of the schedules from your view, uncheck the box to the left of the schedule name in the Schedules section of the left sidebar. Editing or Deleting Existing Schedules If you need to edit your schedules (i.e. change the name, color, video conferencing link, or custom appointment text), hover over its name in the Schedules section of the left sidebar, and the Edit option will appear. Once you click on the Edit button, the Schedule Details window will open. From here, you can update any of the information, and then click the Submit button to save your changes. You can also delete the schedule from this menu by clicking on the red Delete Schedule button . Deleting schedules is permanent and they cannot be recovered. If there are booked appointments for the schedule you are trying to delete, you will need to select a schedule to move those appointments to before you can delete the schedule.

    "body": "Overview You can link calendars to checklist items so that families can sign up for events right from their checklist! In this article, we'll walk through the steps of setting up a calendar checklist item! Before we dive in, here are a couple of important reminders about calendars.... So...why shouldn't I use public links for students who have a checklist? Public links create an inquiry form every time they are used to sign up for an event. If a student with an Admissions checklist fills out an event sign-up from a public link, it creates an inquiry for them and, therefore, can result in duplicate records and mixed-up statuses! And anyway, for all students who have already applied, you can just have them sign up for events through their checklist. Pop some Popcorn! New to Calendars or need a refresher? Check out our quick learn video here. It's under 5 minutes! In this Article Link a Calendar to a Checklist Item Set up the calendar Set up the checklist Parent Checklist Experience Admin Checklist Experience Duplicate Appointment Bookings Link a Calendar to a new Checklist Item Set up the calendar Before setting up the checklist, you'll see to check a setting within the Calendar itself. Navigate to the Calendar (Scheduling &gt; Calendars &gt; Select the Calendar Name.) Open the Calendar Settings menu and select Edit Settings. Scroll to the Calendar Access section. Within that section, make sure that the following is selected: \"Allow parents to book appointments via the checklist in the Parent Portal\" Select Submit to save your changes. Good to know: You may notice in the Calendar Access section, you have a couple of additional options: Allow parents to cancel and reschedule booked appointments in the Parent Portal. Make calendar available through public link: This allows you to share the calendar via a link that can be posted on your website or in an email. This is meant for prospects and inquiries only. Remember: Do not send Public Links for students who have already applied! Students in the admissions and enrollment workflow should always be booking and scheduling events through their checklists. See it in Action Set up the checklist Follow these steps to connect a calendar to your checklist! First, open your Admissions or Enrollment checklist (Settings &gt; Checklists.) Select Add a New Checklist item. Type in a name for the checklist item (this is parent-facing.) The canonical name is an internal name and it will populate automatically. Enter a parent explanation. This is also parent-facing. If applicable, select a permission to determine which admin can see the checklist item. Select your visibility preference. (If it's required, leave box boxes unchecked.) For the Item Type, select Calendar. This opens the calendar dropdown menu. Set the terms. The Start Term tells the checklist item which term it should first start to appear in. The End Term tells the checklist item the last term it should appear in. You can leave the end term blank if you don't want the checklist item to expire. If there are specific grades that the Checklist item should appear for, select them by clicking on the Grades box. If you need a rule added to specify the student group this should appear to, contact support and we can help! See it in Action Parent Checklist Experience When the family goes into their checklist, they can select the Schedule Appointment button. When they select it, they will be brought to the calendar where they can select and book their date for the event. If you've included the option to allow them to cancel and reschedule, they will also have those options in the checklist after booking. See it in Action Admin Checklist Experience Within the student checklist, on the admin side, you will see the date and time of the appointment reflected after the student books it. You also have the option to reschedule and cancel the appointment. Clicking on View Appointment opens a pop-up that displays the appointment details. Calendar Checklist Item Management Notice in the image below that the checklist item is not marked as complete. Calendar checklist items do not get automatically checked off. They must be managed manually. This is by design because it allows you to use the item to track which students actually attended the event. After the event is complete, create an event search and use the bulk update feature to update the checklist items for students who attended. Booking appointments for students Did you know that you can book appointments for students right from their checklist? Learn how in our Registering Students for Events as an Admin article. Duplicate Appointment Bookings If a parent books a duplicate appointment for the event, both appointments will be displayed on their checklist. (They'll display on your end in the Admin-facing checklist as well.) If you've allowed parents to cancel/reschedule appointments in the parent-facing checklist, they'll have the option to cancel/reschedule any of the appointments. In other words, if a parent has signed up for an event three times, they'll have the cancel/re-schedule option for all three bookings.

    "body": "Overview Public Calendar Links allow your families to sign up for events in your Finalsite Enrollment site, such as Open Houses or Tours, with a direct link from your school\u2019s website or emails. This can be helpful for families who just want to register for a single event your school is hosting, instead of filling out an entire inquiry form right away. When you set up calendar events in the Scheduling tab of your Finalsite Enrollment site, you have the option to make them public. This option becomes available after a new calendar has been created and the hyperlink has been created in the system for that calendar.

In this Article Set Up a Public Calendar Link Manage Public Calendar Sign-Ups Duplicate Bookings Best Practices Set Up a Public Calendar Link To start setting up a public calendar link, navigate to the Scheduling tab in your Finalsite Enrollment site, then click on Calendars and select the calendar that you want to make public from the list. To learn how to create a new calendar, click here . Once the calendar page has opened, click on the green Calendar Settings button in the top right and select Edit Settings from the menu. In the calendar settings, scroll down to the Calendar Access section and check the box for 'Make calendar available through public link'. Once you have done so, a hyperlink will appear. This is the direct link to your calendar, which you can copy and paste into your website, emails, or elsewhere for families to click on and register for the event. Remember to click Submit to save your changes! Manage Public Calendar Sign-Ups Event Registration When a family clicks the public link, they are taken to a Finalsite Enrollment page that has your calendar and any available dates listed. They will simply click on a date and enter the required information to register for the event. By default, this is the only information that public calendar sign-ups must provide: Student First &amp; Last Name Student Apply Grade Student Apply Year Parent/Guardian First &amp; Last Name Parent/Guardian Email Parent/Guardian Phone If you want to collect additional information about the family (e.g. interests for shadow day, t-shirt size, etc.), consider setting up a Custom Appointment Form . Post Registration Families who register for an event through a public link will receive email confirmations or reminders as configured in the settings for that calendar. The system will create inquiry records with all of the basic appointment information for each student that signs up, along with their parent/guardian contact. From the admin side, the submitted form will look like an inquiry, but it will contain only basic information. If a family needs to change or cancel their registration, they will need to contact the school, so that this can be taken care of on the Admin side. The school can then cancel the existing appointment, and the parent can click on the link again to sign up for a different date and/or time. Duplicate Appointment Bookings When you share a Public Calendar link , families can easily click the link, select a date, and input their information. Since it's a public link without login requirements, there's no way to stop someone from accidentally signing up multiple times. To help you manage duplicate bookings, we've set up layers of alerts to notify you, allowing you to check in with the family and remove any duplicate bookings. You'll see the duplicate appointment in your event search, on the student checklist, and when importing the forms in the Forms inbox.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment the Calendars can feed into external calendar programs like Microsoft Outlook, Apple Calendar (desktop, iPhone, or iPad), or Google Calendar. Finalsite Enrollment uses the common format known as iCal to provide these feeds. Changes within the Finalsite Enrollment calendar will be updated within the external calendar program. Please note: ALL changes to appointments MUST be made within Finalsite Enrollment. If they are made in your external calendar, they will not update in Finalsite Enrollment. Refresh Rates: Depending on the mail program you sync with, refresh rates vary as defined below, and are determined by the mail provider. Google Calendar refreshes daily only Apple Calendar by default refreshes weekly, however, the refresh rate can be adjusted to as frequently as every 5 minutes in the calendar settings when you add the iCal feed. Microsoft Outlook for PCs refreshes daily only. Microsoft Outlook for Mac does not support calendar feeds. We unfortunately have no control over this. Calendar Feed Setup Instruction First, you will need the calendar feed URL. Within Finalsite Enrollment, click on Scheduling , then select Calendars and select the Calendar you wish to subscribe to. Then click on Calendar Settings in the upper right, highlighted in green and select Sync with an outside calendar . A pop-up dialog box will open with the iCal Feed URL at the bottom. Copy the link shown. Now that you have the iCal Feed URL, review the steps below based on the type of calendar you would like to sync with. Apple Calendar To set up a calendar feed in the Apple Calendar application, select File \u2013 New Calendar Subscription from the menu application\u2019s bar. In the pop-up dialog box, paste the Finalsite Enrollment iCal link (Command+V) in the Calendar URL field and click Subscribe. Once the calendar is done processing, you can name the calendar, set the default location, set refresh dates, or remove alerts and attachments. Note: For Auto-Refresh, settings we recommend making it the interval every 5-15 minutes so that you always see the latest changes. Once you click \u201cOK\u201d, all of the filled spots will show up on your calendar. Google Calendar To set up an iCal Calendar feed in Google Calendar, go to calendar.google.com or log into your account and click on the Google Apps menu in the upper right by your name and then click on the Calendar App icon. Along the left of the page, select the plus sign next to the Other Calendars section and then select Add by URL . Paste the Finalsite Enrollment iCal link into the URL Field and then click Add Calendar. Google will now grab the names and dates out of the calendar feed. Please note that Google only checks for updates every few hours. This is not user-customizable. Important note: Google Calendar does not provide user control over the refresh setting like many other calendar programs do (for example, Apple Calendar). This means the calendar feed will only update once per day with new appointments or changes to existing appointments. Microsoft Outlook Mac Microsoft does not support subscribing to webcal standard feeds in Outlook for the Mac. Microsoft Outlook Windows Subscribe to a calendar On the Outlook navigation bar, click the App Launcher, and then click Calendar . Under the Outlook Calendar navigation bar, click the New down arrow, and click Add calendar . Click ' From internet' , and in the Link to the calendar box, type or copy and paste the web address of the calendar. In the Calendar name box, enter a name for the linked calendar. Click Save .

It automatically tracks the cumulative totals in real-time of your: Inquiries Applicants Application Completes Accepted Enrollment in Progress Enrolled Students You can click on all of these cumulative numbers in the center of the funnel to open a list of contacts. Cumulative numbers include anyone that\u2019s been that particular status at any point in time. This means, your number of applicants will include anyone that\u2019s ever been in an Applicant status, as well as any of those applicants that moved on to other stages of the funnel. To the left of the Admissions Funnel, you can see important statistics calculated for you known as the Yield Comparison (4) . These percentage values are derived from the previous status. In the example below, we can see that 93% of our Inquiries became Applicants and of those Applicants, 89% became Application Complete. All percentage values can be clicked on to populate the list of contacts included in that count. The percentage value in dark grey is your yield (5) , which is the number of Applicants that became Enrolled, as indicated by the dotted line connecting these two statuses with the yield percentage. Current Counts Below the Admissions Funnel are your current counts of those progressing through each stage of the admissions process. Current counts display how many contacts are currently in that particular status right now. Please refer to the Help Article on Statuses to see what each of these mean. Each status and numerical value listed in blue can be clicked on to populate the list of contacts for that particular status.

    "body": "Overview During the Review Process, you may have current Finalsite Enrollment users that are part of the review process or other staff members such as teachers that are part of the review process. Even if certain members of the review committee don\u2019t have access to Finalsite Enrollment, you can still assign them as a reader only, which means they won\u2019t have access to any information that isn\u2019t included in the review packet. To assign both user types, read below for a more detailed explanation. Assigning Current Finalsite Enrollment Users as Readers To assign a current Finalsite Enrollment user to be a Reader, navigate to Settings\u2013Portal\u2013Admin Portal Accounts . Locate the name of the user, and then check the reader checkbox. The reader permission can be given to any user of the Finalsite Enrollment system. For User and Admin accounts, it allows them to be assigned students to review and gives them access to their candidates in review list page, which is found within the Admissions tab. -- *Important Notes about Admin and User Account Permissions* ' User ' accounts cannot see anyone else's reviews of candidates except their own , they cannot \"Manage Readers\" in the Edit menu of the Admissions List Page (which is how you assign readers to candidates) and they also can't view the Candidates in Review page for Committee Review. ' Admin ' accounts that do not have the reader checkbox marked, always have read access to the Review tab on a student\u2019s record, but they can only edit their review answers (if they are assigned to the Student). Admin users also have access to the candidates in review tab on the admissions screen which shows the status of all students currently under review and the scores they have received. Assigning Non-Finalsite Enrollment Users as Readers Schools often have staff members that review candidates during the Review Process that shouldn't have full access to Finalsite Enrollment. To support this level of access, there's an account type called 'Limited User.' Their permissions are as follows: Limited users only have access to the Review Module. Limited users do not have access to contact records, admissions or enrollment list pages, billing, etc. Limited users can only see their reviews and not the review results of any other readers. To assign a non-Finalsite Enrollment user to be a Reader, navigate to Settings\u2013Portal\u2013Admin Portal Accounts . Click on add a new admin in green in the upper left and fill out the email, name, and password for the admin account. For \u201ctype\u201d select ' Limited User.' Once the limited user type is set, the user will only have the reader checkbox marked, and all others will remain unchecked. You won\u2019t be able to give access to any other areas of Finalsite Enrollment when the limited user type is selected. -- Notes: Whenever you assign reader permissions to any individual (whether they are an Admin, User, Limited User, etc.) the ' Reviews assigned to me (Daily Summary) ' email is automatically enabled. Once a day, the reader will receive an email that lists all candidates that have been assigned to them for review. The email is sent only once per day, very early in the morning. They can turn off this notification within their Username menu on the 'User Notifications' page. You can read more about user notifications here .

    "body": "Overview Readers are assigned to candidates by Admin or System Admins with Admissions permissions. They can be assigned individually from the student record, or, in bulk on the Applicants Workflow list page. Readers can either be existing users, or you can assign reader permission to other staff members who need to review candidates but do not need access to the system. Who can assign readers to candidates? Types: System Admin or Admin Permissions: Admissions In this article Assign Readers to Candidates from the Student Record Assign Readers to Candidates in Bulk from the Admissions List Page Reader Notification Reader Experience Reader-Only View Admin with Reader Permissions View Assign Readers to Candidates from the Student Record Admins and System Admin can manage (assign or remove) readers directly from the student record. To Add A Reader Open the Edit dropdown Menu in the top right. Select Manage Readers . In the Action column, Assign should automatically be selected. If it's not, select it. In the Readers dropdown, select or type in the name of the reader you'd like to add. Click Save . A few additional notes: The reader(s) will automatically be notified by email that they have been assigned to the candidate. Upon assignment, the candidate's status is automatically adjusted in the system to Review in Progress. This is an internal-only status that parents will not see. It is not recommended to manually change a student's status to Review in Progress but, rather, allow the system to automatically apply the status with the assignment of the reader. To Remove a Reader Open the Edit dropdown Menu in the top right. Select Manage Readers . In the Action column, select Remove. In the Readers dropdown, select or type in the name of the reader you'd like to remove. Click Save . A few additional notes: Readers are not automatically notified that they have been removed from the candidate. The removed reader(s)' comments and scores will no longer appear on the candidate(s)' record. If you reassign the reader(s) to the contact(s) later, any comments and scores will be restored. Assign Readers to Candidates in Bulk from the Admissions List Page Admins and System Admin with Admissions permission can manage (assign or remove) readers in bulk from the Applicants Workflow page (Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Applicants). Now that's an idea! To streamline the assignment process it might make sense for your school to use the Filter Options in the Applicants Workflow page to narrow your candidate pool when assigning readers. For example, if you assign specific readers to international students, you can filter this page to show only international students to easily assign candidates to them. Pro tip: You can request Custom Filter options added to the dropdown by contacting our Support team. Assign Readers in Bulk Navigate to Admissions &gt; Students in Admissions &gt; Applicants .

This means that, once a day, the admin receives an email in the morning that lists all candidates that have been assigned to them for review. Additional Notes Notifications are sent out once per day (very early in the morning), which means the assigned readers won\u2019t get multiple notifications in a day if you add additional students or remove students later that same day. Readers can turn off this notification within their Username menu on the User Notifications page. You can read more about user notifications here. Reader Experience Depending on the permissions setup of your readers, they will see slightly different things on the student record. Read below to learn about the view of a Limited User reviewer vs. the view of someone who has permissions as an Admin at the school. Reader Only (Limited User) View When a reader without full Finalsite Enrollment access logs in, they will be presented with their Review List Page, which will show all outstanding candidates left to be reviewed under the My Assigned Reviews tab. Once a candidate has been scored on all rating criteria, they will move to the My Completed Reviews tab. To begin the review process, each reader will click on the green Review button to the left of each candidate's name. Admin w/Reader Permissions View For any admins or users with reading rights, you can access your assigned candidate list within the Admissions List Page &gt; My Reviews tab. All outstanding candidates left to be reviewed will be displayed under the My Assigned Reviews tab. Once a candidate has been scored on all rating criteria, they will move to the My Completed Reviews tab. Please note, that it may take a few minutes for the candidate to move from one tab to the next.

The Reading Process Cover Sheet The Reader can start by clicking on the green ' Review ' button to the left of any student names on the list. The first thing Readers will see is the Candidate\u2019s Cover Sheet . They can review the information on the Cover Sheet, including the demographics and key information at the top of the cover sheet. If you have candidates that re-applied or left and came back later on, you can select the review year from the drop-down menu in the upper right of the candidate cover sheet. This means you can view reviews from previous years. All reader comments left during the review will be summarized in the cover sheet and the reader scores entered on the last page of the review packet. The review scores can also be edited from this page. Readers may start reading by clicking on the green \u201c Start Reading \u201d button in the bottom right. Document Comments On each document, Readers can type optional comments . Comments are automatically saved as they are typed. Note: Only users and admins with the admissions and reader permissions can see all Reader\u2019s comments. Limited users with just reader access can only see their comments and scores, and not those of other assigned readers. -- Summary Comments Once a Reader is done reviewing each document, they are presented with a page to score the candidate. Within this page, you'll find the ' Summary Comments ' section. This allows readers to type up their overall feelings on each candidate. A comment summary is helpful for the Committee Review. Reader Scores Next, readers can score candidates on your school's rating criteria and scales. Scores are selected from the rating criteria drop-down menus. Once complete, readers can continue to the next Candidate's review packet or return to the Review List Page. Reviews completed by the Reader are moved to the ' Completed Reviews ' tab. Please note, it may take a few minutes for your candidates to change tabs. Readers can review and edit their candidate scores even when candidates have been moved to the 'Completed Reviews' tab.

    "body": "Overview The review committee often meets multiple times during the reading season to make decision recommendations for students. They may have the final say over the decisions that were made, or their input is taken into account by the head of the school when making final decisions. No matter the process, the Review Committee has to weigh many factors beyond the quality of the candidate including, but not limited to class balance, financial aid, scholarships, and legacy. It is a difficult process and affects the lives of many families. We hope that Finalsite Enrollment Reviews can help facilitate the review process to allow schools to focus on the important decisions, and not get bogged down in the management of the process. Admissions Directors can keep tabs throughout the process via the Candidates in Review tab. Click on the Admissions tab &gt; Students in Admission &gt; Candidates in Review . How to Manage Candidates At a glance, committee members can see which students have completed the Reading process or which candidates are still pending based on the scores that display and the status of the review progress column. Additional columns and filters can be added to this view via the Review Setup pages--List Page Columns &amp; Filters. Click here to learn more. -- Filter Options This page can be filtered via the filter options menu, which can be customized in the review settings mentioned above. Some default filters include sorting by assigned reviewers and the reading progress of each candidate. This allows you to see what candidates are assigned to each reader if you want more focused discussions in the process. A complete reading progress status means all assigned readers have scored the candidate in all categories. Any additional filters customized in the review settings will display below these options. Candidates can also be sorted in ascending or descending order by clicking on the customized column headers. To sort in ascending or descending order by score averages, click on the rating criteria column headers along the right. -- Review Progress Column By hovering over the ' review progress' cell for each student, an admin can see which readers have completed their review of the candidate and which readers have yet to complete their review. A green check mark indicates that all assigned readers have completed their review of the candidate. Review progress is also available as a filter option on this page. -- Scoring Columns If there are multiple readers, the scores will be averaged. The admin can hover over the score and see the individual scores that made up the composite score. For the Combined Average %, the system converts each score to a percentage based on the scale for that criterion and then averages those percentages together. This means criteria that are 1-10 will have finer grain percentages (steps of 10%) available than criteria that are 1-3 (steps of 33%). -- Review Comments Column All ' Review Comments ' are summarized in a condensed column view next to the 'Reading Progress' column along the far right. Click on the arrow to expand the comments. Comments will be broken out by the reader and will include all checklist item comments as well as the summary comments from the scoring page. Preliminary Review Decisions A preliminary review decision can be made directly from this page by clicking on the text. If you set a preliminary decision for a candidate, you can change it at any point later on to either a different decision or back to none. Please note, these decisions do not affect the status of your candidates and they are not viewable to parents in the parent portal. Click here to learn more about setting up these decisions. While the process varies from school to school, it is fairly common for the Director of Admissions to make a preliminary recommendation so that the committee meeting can focus on the students who need a more in-depth conversation for consideration. Post Committee Meeting Once final decisions are made, Admissions staff can filter out students based on their preliminary review decisions in the filter options and then perform a bulk status change to set the final decisions such as accepted, waitlisted, denied, etc. Notifications to parents can also be performed in bulk via email or letter.

    "body": "Overview The Duplicate Household Matching page is where you can identify potential duplicate households in your Finalsite Enrollment site, and merge them either individually or in bulk. Duplicate households typically occur if one of the following is true: A contact that inquired filled out an application form and the household address is the same. A contact that inquired filled out an application form and typed the address slightly differently. A related contact of an existing inquiry or applicant student has the same address as the existing contact. The system checks for potential households once per day, early in the morning. How-To: Understand the Duplicate Household Matching Page You can access the Duplicate Household Matching page by navigating to 'Settings' - 'Fields &amp; Data' - 'Duplicate Household Matching'. Within this page, you will see a list of any potential duplicate households the system has detected, along with the following columns. Household 1: The first household in the system that has a potential match with Household 2. Household 2: The second household in the system that has a potential match with Household 1. Status: The status is listed as Pending Review until you resolve the match. You can click this column header to sort by Status. Other statuses include: Pending Review: A match that has not yet been reviewed. Ignored: A match that was ignored by an admin/user. Pending Merge: A match that is pending a merge. Failed Merge: Merge was attempted but failed. Contact Support for help troubleshooting. Match Score: This indicates how weak or strong the match is (i.e. how likely it is that the two households are actually the same). You can click this column header to sort by Match Score. The match score ranges are: 0-124: unknown (very unlikely a match) 125-149: weak match 150-224: medium match 225-300: strong match 301 and above: herculean match (extremely likely the households are a match) Herculean is the strongest match and is typically safe for bulk merging households. Match Strength: This is the verbal strength of the match according to the match score (see above). You can click this column header to sort by Match Strength. Last Checked: This is the date that the duplicate match checker ran. You can click this column header to sort by Last Checked. Resolve: Click here to resolve the match and begin the duplicate matching process. Using Filter Options You can use the blue 'Filter Options' button at the top of the page to filter the list by search text or match status. This is useful if you want to search for a specific household address to see if there is a duplicate match for it. Input the information (e.g. street name) in the search text box, and click the blue 'Apply Filter' button to confirm. The filter options are defaulted to show matches that are in a status of Pending Review and Failed Merge. Click the red 'Clear Filters' button to remove any filters you have added. How-To: Resolve a Duplicate Household Match On the Duplicate Household Matching page, you can click the 'Resolve' button to the right of any row to start the duplicate matching process for those two households. The Resolve Duplicate window will pop up with the addresses and household contacts for both Household 1 and Household 2, so that you can review and compare the two. If after reviewing the information, you determine that the two are not the same household and shouldn't be merged, you can click the blue 'No, hide this match' button and the match will be ignored. This means you won't see it on the duplicate household matching page when you return to the page, but you can still filter by status 'Ignored' if you want to revisit it in the future. If you do decide to merge the two households , you can click the blue 'Yes, merge them!' button. You will then be asked to pick which household should take precedence in the case of conflicts, which we\u2019ll refer to as the \u201cwinning record.\u201d The household you select as the winning record will be the one whose information the system keeps in the case of conflicting data. When merging, the following behavior will occur: If any fields are filled out for both records, the field data on the winning record will take precedence over the field data for the losing record. For any fields that exist in the losing record and not in the winning record, those fields of information will carry over from the losing record to the winning record. All of the household contacts from both the winning and losing record should end up on the merged record. In the example below, the address is the same except for the country (United States) is filled out for Household 1. Within the household contacts, two of the contacts are the same and the other two only show up in Household 1. Whichever household takes precedence, all of the information below will carry over since nothing gets deleted in the merge. However, if the house number for Household 1 was 1008 Aiken Drive, while it was 1004 Aiken Drive for Household 2, choosing Household 1 would then take that house number (i.e. 1008) as precedence over the one in Household 2. All remaining details would carry over. In this example, either household will give you the same results.

    "body": "Overview The Documents for Review setting contains Checklist Items, Notes, and Activities which can all be custom set according to your Review process for that year. How you've managed your Admissions process is key to having the proper setup for your online reading and review process. Approaching your Admissions process with the reading and review process in mind will help you define what you may need to add to your Admission process so that your readers and committee have all of the information needed. This includes parent-facing forms and/or files as well as internal-facing forms and/or files such as an Interview Notes form. You may also have certain notes/activities within the 'Recent Activity' section of the record tagged for the Review process only so that you can separate which notes are important for your readers/committee. How-To Under Checklist Items, set which items from the checklist to include when reviewing a candidate by toggling between yes and no. The only checklist items shown are the ones that have data associated with them, such as forms, document uploads, or recommendations. Checklist items like calendar events do not show. Please note that when reviewing a candidate, only checklist items that apply to that candidate will be shown. For example, if there are checklist items for upper school like transcripts that do not apply to kindergarten candidates, those checklist items will not show for those candidates. Further down, under Notes and Activities , you can also select which ones to include for your Readers in the Review Process by toggling between yes and no. This is useful if you want to keep the comments that were recorded throughout the Application process and you want to expose those to the Readers. Once you\u2019ve made your changes, make sure to click on the \u201c Save Settings \u201d button in the upper right. Hide From Form (Hiding Form Data from Reviewers) The Hide From Form option is available within Field Settings when creating or editing a field. Choosing this option enables you to conceal the data stored within the field from admins who view the form. This can be particularly important during reviews if there's sensitive information on the form that shouldn't be visible to users reviewing it. In such cases, utilizing the Hide From Form option can be beneficial. When Hide From Form is selected for a field, it conceals the value of that field from admins when they view it on a form. For instance, in the image below, both the Gender field and the Applicant's Birth Date field have Hide From Form enabled. Consequently, when an admin views the form, they will not see the data stored in those fields. When \"Hide From Form\" is selected: Parents will still be able to see the data within the field on their end. Regardless of an admin's permission level, whenever they view forms on the record, download the PDF version of the form, or check out the form in the review module, they will encounter 'Hidden From View' instead of the actual data for any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled. This only applies to viewing the field on a form. Any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled will continue to display its data within searches, on the contact record (if the field is visible in the Contact Widget or within tabs like Personal, Admissions, or Enrollment ), in emails, and any other location where the field is displayed. The information is only hidden from admin when the view the field on a form. Good to know: Hide Form Form is reversible. You can de-select ' Hide From Form' in the field settings at any time and, as soon as you do so, the data will start to display again.

    "body": "Overview The Duplicate Contact Matching page is where you can identify potential duplicate contacts in your Finalsite Enrollment site, and merge them either individually or in bulk. Duplicate contacts typically occur if one of the following is true: A contact that inquired filled out an application form and the contacts were not merged upon form import. A contact inquired multiple times or applied multiple times and the contacts were not merged upon form import. A related contact such as a sibling or parent is matched to multiple inquiry students or applicant students. New contacts are created through an import run without duplicate matching. The system checks for potential duplicate contacts once per day, early in the morning. How-To: Understand the Duplicate Contact Matching Page You can access the Duplicate Contact Matching page by navigating to 'Settings' - 'Fields &amp; Data' - 'Duplicate Contact Matching'. Within this page, you will see a list of any potential duplicate contacts the system has detected, along with the following columns. Contact 1: The first contact in the system that has a potential match with Contact 2. Contact 2: The second contact in the system that has a potential match with Contact 1. Status: The status is listed as Pending Review until you resolve the match. You can click this column header to sort by Status. Other statuses include: Pending Review: A match that has not yet been reviewed. Ignored: A match that was ignored by an admin/user. Pending Merge: A match that is pending a merge. Failed Merge: Merge was attempted but failed - click here for potential failure reasons. If a merge fails from the duplicate contact matching page, you can try instead to merge the contacts from the Duplicate Check &amp; Merge Tool . Match Score: This indicates how weak or strong the match is (i.e. how likely it is that the two contacts are actually the same person). You can click this column header to sort by Match Score. The match score ranges are: 0-124: unknown (very unlikely a match) 125-149: weak match 150-224: medium match 225-300: strong match 301 and above: herculean match (extremely likely the contacts are a match) Match Strength: This is the verbal strength of the match according to the match score (see above). You can click this column header to sort by Match Strength. Last Checked: This is the date that the duplicate match checker ran. You can click this column header to sort by Last Checked. Resolve: Click this button to resolve the match and begin the duplicate matching process. Debug: Click this button to open the match pair in the Duplicate Check &amp; Merge Tool and do a force merge. Using Filter Options You can use the blue 'Filter Options' button at the top of the page to filter the list by search text or match status. This is useful if you want to search for a specific contact by name to see if there is a duplicate match for them. Input their first or last name in the search text box, and click the blue 'Apply Filter' button to confirm. The filter options are defaulted to show matches that are in a status of Pending Review and Failed Merge. Click the red 'Clear Filters' button to remove any filters you have added. How-To: Resolve a Duplicate Contact Match On the Duplicate Contact Matching page, you can click the 'Resolve' button to the right of any row to start the duplicate matching process for those two contacts. The Resolve Duplicate window will pop up with some key information and related contacts for both Contact 1 and Contact 2, so that you can review and compare the two. If after reviewing the information, you determine that the two are not the same contact and shouldn't be merged, you can click the blue 'No, hide this match' button and the match will be ignored. This means you won't see it on the duplicate contact matching page when you return to the page, but you can still filter by status 'Ignored' if you want to revisit it in the future. If you do decide to merge the two contacts , you can click the blue 'Yes, merge them!' button. You will then be asked to pick which contact should take precedence in the case of conflicts, which we\u2019ll refer to as the \u201cwinning record.\u201d The contact you select as the winning record will be the one whose information the system keeps in the case of conflicting data. When merging, the following behavior will occur: If any fields are filled out for both records, the field data on the winning record will take precedence over the field data for the losing record. For any fields that exist in the losing record and not in the winning record, those fields of information will carry over from the losing record to the winning record. Merging does not delete information , even if it only exists on the losing record and not on the winning record. Those details will carry over to the winning record. All of the related contacts from both the winning and losing record should end up on the merged record. If a contact was related to both the winning and losing record, the contact should only be related to the merged record once and the relationship from the winning record should be used.

    "body": "Overview Your Rating Criteria consists of the specific Rating Categories - the items your readers will use to evaluate candidates - and the associated Scoring Scales for each of those categories. How-To: Set Up Rating Criteria Navigate to Settings &gt; General &gt; Review in your Finalsite Enrollment site. From the Review Setup Page, select Rating Criteria along the lefthand side. Then, click on the green Add a Rating Category at the bottom to create your new rating category. Type your rating criteria in the blank field, then click on See Details along the right of the category name. This will allow you to create a scoring scale and indicate if the category is school level-specific and/or gender-specific. Example: -- Scoring Scales Rating scales can be numerical values or text values. The scoring scale should always go from lowest to highest . Scores are averaged together on the Candidates in Review Tab and the system expects scores to go from low to high to calculate averages. If you need to delete a rating scale, hover over it and click on the red 'X' along the right - remember to click save after doing so. -- Set Applicable School Levels &amp; Genders Rating Categories will be shown for all students by default. However, you can optionally choose to select a specific school level or gender to whom the rating category will apply. This is helpful if you have different rating criteria for different groups of students (e.g. for lower school vs. upper school students). You can select the school level(s) for each rating criterion in the Applicable School Levels field, or the gender in Applicable Genders . Please note that school levels are configured under Settings \u2013 General \u2013 Grades . If you have a Rating Category that may not apply to certain students within a school level or gender, you can use the N/A option (described above under Scoring Scales) and exclude it from the combined score. How-To: Use Weighted Scores Rating Categories can be weighted so that a score provides more or less weight in the final combined score. To remove the criteria from the final combined score, apply a weight of zero (0). If you want to weight the criteria twice as much in the final combined score, apply a weight of two (2). You can also use decimals. -- How Weights Affect the Final Score The final score is calculated by taking the score as a decimal, applying the weight, and then dividing the total score by the number of valid criteria adjust for weighting. For example, let's assign the criteria the following weights and scores: Criteria A = weight 0, score 1.0 (100%) Criteria B = weight 0.5, score 1.0 (100%) Criteria C = weight 1, score 0.8 (80% aka 4 out of 5 score) Criteria D = weight 2, score 0.7 (70% aka 7 out of 10 score) Unweighted, the average is 0.875 or 87.5% (1 + 1 + 0.8 + 0.7 divided by 4). Weighted, the average is 0.771 or 77.1% (0 + 0.5 + 0.8 + 1.4 divided by 3.5) -- Use case: Remove a rating category from the combined score A common use case is to have a rating category that is for informational use, but that should not be calculated into the final combined score. For example, an overall recommendation by the reader or another secondary factor. In this case, to remove this rating category's score from the final score, apply a weight of zero (0) to the rating category and it will not be included in the final score. -- Use case: A single overweighted score One method of scoring is to have one score weighted as 25% of the final score, and have any other scores be worth the remaining 75%. To do this, you would set the value of the 25% score to 0.25 and then divide the remaining 75% by the number of remaining rating categories. For example, if there were five remaining valid rating categories, the scoring would look like this: Criteria A (25%) = 0.25 Criteria B to F (75%) = 0.15 Whole numbers 2.5 and 1.5 would have worked in this example, the math is the same. -- Notes &amp; Best Practices Criteria can be dynamic based on school level or gender. In some cases, you may have rating categories that don't apply to a certain student, so when calculating your weights only consider the rating criteria that will be present. A best practice is to keep most all weights at 1 (default) and then overweight or underweight a few criteria. Weights can be updated at any time. As soon as they are updated, the calculation will be reflected upon refreshing the Candidates in Review page.

    "body": "Overview Checklists are central to driving your workflows in Finalsite Enrollment. This article will go over how to configure checklist items and their settings. For a general overview of checklists in Finalsite Enrollment, click here . How-To: Manage Checklists Within Settings - Checklists , you can manage the following checklists (based on the modules you have purchased with Finalsite Enrollment): Inquiry Checklist: The Inquiry checklist is admin-facing (internal) ONLY. Parents do not have a checklist at the Inquiry phase, and cannot view any items contained within. For this reason, your Inquiry checklist should center around items your internal team can take to engage with the family. Admissions Checklist: The admissions checklist is created once families submit an application form. After the form is submitted, parents will create a Parent Portal Account and the checklist becomes available. Parents will see the required and optional checklist items only. Enrollment Checklist: The enrollment checklist becomes available once you either move your new students to an enrollment-in-progress status or once you perform rollover for your returning students. Parents will see the required and optional checklist items only. Once you have selected the desired checklist from these three options, make sure that you select the correct Term from the drop-down menu at the top of the page before you start making your changes. Within the checklist setup page, you have access to the following options: Checklist Order: Checklist items can be dragged and dropped to the desired position in the list. The order will display on both the admin side and the parent side (if applicable). Please note: Required checklist items will always display above all Optional or Internal checklist items, regardless of the order set. Form Preview: For any form type checklist item, you can click on the form icon next to the checklist type name to preview the form for that checklist item. This includes the Inquiry, Application, and Contract, as well as custom Online Forms, Recommendations, and Document Requests. Calendar Preview: Similar to the Form Preview, for any calendar type checklist item, you can click on the calendar icon next to the checklist type name to preview the calendar for that checklist item. Edit: Here you can edit the checklist details as described below. How-To: Add or Edit a Checklist Item To create a new checklist item, click on the green plus sign or text in the upper left for ' Add a new checklist item '. To edit an existing checklist item, click on the blue ' Edit ' button to the right of the item. Once in the checklist item details window, you can create or update the following information: Attributes Name: Name of the checklist item. This is what displays to parents and admins when viewing the student checklist. Canonical Name: Name used on the backend of the system (not parent-facing), and cannot be changed for existing checklist items. When creating a new checklist item, a canonical name will be created automatically as you type based on the checklist name you enter. However, you can also choose to enter your own canonical name (lowercase letters and underscores only). Parent Explanation: Description text that displays in the Parent Portal for all Admissions and Enrollment checklist items that are set to required or optional visibility. Explanation text is not viewable on any Admin-facing checklists including the Inquiry checklist, or on internal-facing checklist items. It is important to provide explanation text so the parent/guardian knows what to do in order for the item to be marked as complete. HTML formatting is supported in Parent Explanations. Visibility: Checklist items are categorized as Required by default, but can be set as Optional or Internal using the checkboxes here. See the 'Checklist Visibility' section here for more information. Please note: All Inquiry checklist items are admin-facing (internal) only, so they do not need to be marked as internal. Type Item Type: Drop-down menu where you can select the type of checklist item (e.g. File Upload, Online Form, Calendar, etc.). Some special checklist items, such as the application and associated application fee, have a hardcoded type that cannot be edited. Click here for an explanation of the different checklist item types. Criteria Only applies to Enrollment checklist items: Enrollment Type: Select the applicable enrollment type (i.e. New or Returning) for the checklist item. When you do so, the checklist item will only appear on the checklist for students with that enrollment type. To have the checklist item appear for both New and Returning students, leave this field blank. Payment Plans: Select the payment plan(s) for which the checklist item will display, based on the payment plan selection on the contract. Applies to all checklist items: Terms (Start and End Term): Set the start and end terms for displaying this checklist item on the checklist. Select the asterisk (*) option to have the checklist item apply to all future years automatically. If you would like to retire a checklist item for all years in the future, set the end term to the prior term. For example, to retire a previously used checklist item for your 2020-2021 students, you could set an end term of 2019-2020 on that checklist item. As a best practice, we do not recommend deleting checklist items that were used at any point, so that the historical data is always maintained. Instead, retire the item. Grades: Select the applicable grade(s) for the checklist item. When you do so, the checklist item will only appear on the checklist for students in the grade(s) selected. If you want the item to appear for all grades, leave this field blank. Business Rule: If you need checklist items to populate for anything other than grade-based or enrollment type criteria, please contact support . This field is read-only. Please note: If you change the business rule for a Required checklist item so that it no longer applies to certain contacts, anyone that became an Inquiry, Applicant, or Enrollment in Progress status prior to the change will not become a completed status (i.e. Inquiry Completed, Application Complete, or Enrolled) automatically. They will need to be manually changed to that status. Remember to click the blue Submit button to save your changes!

    "body": "Overview The Admissions and Enrollment List Pages are a great way to see the status of your admissions and enrollment contacts, and perform a variety of bulk actions. Some examples include downloading completed teacher recommendations or contracts, sending emails to a targeted set of contacts for checklist or form completion, updating checklist items in bulk, and more. Filter Options allow you to drill down on the subset of contacts you want to manage. How to set Filter Options Similar to the Dashboard, there\u2019s filter options on the List Page that are unique to the admissions process. At the top of the page, you have a Terms picker which defaults to the default reporting year. You can select the Term or school year that you wish to view data for by selecting it from the drop-down. Once you have the Term set, click on filter options (1) to display your criteria. Each list page has a pre-defined set of filters that are contextual to the workflow. For example, Applicant list pages have a different set of pre-defined filters than Enrollment list pages. By default, you may have the following filters: Status, Apply/Enroll Grade, and Complete/Incomplete Checklist Items. Your filter options update according to the contact list you select. For example, if you\u2019re viewing a list of Inquiries, you\u2019ll see statuses and checklist items that are specific to Inquiries only. Custom Filter Options We can add custom filter options for all list pages as long as the field is a boolean, single-select, or multi-select field. Each custom filter option will display on all list pages, the dashboard, and report pages where 'filter options' are displayed. They cannot be customized on a per page basis. To request custom filters, contact Finalsite Enrollment Support . Some best practices for filter option considerations include: Pick fields you'll use often to send targeted communications or for checklist management. Any one-off fields can be used within Search and Reports. Some examples include International Y/N, Boarding/Day, Academic or Athletic Interests, etc. Pick fields with smaller option lists. A \"current school\" single select field wouldn't be a good option as there's too many results and would cause scrolling in the list page. This information can be reported on more easily within Search and Reports. Applying Filter Options Next, you can apply filters to drill down for specific contacts within your process for targeted communications, checklist completion or any other relevant bulk action. Check off the criteria you want to filter by (2) and then click apply filter (3) . Some examples you can try are: Filter all of your elementary, middle school, or high school students for a given apply year. Filter for all of your Accepted kids so that you can change their status in bulk to Enrollment in Progress via the Edit menu. Filter all of your applicants that completed their application form (complete checklist item) but did not complete their application fee (incomplete checklist item). Show Students by Current Term only Filter Within the Filter Options, there\u2019s a show students by current term filter. This filter is turned on by default, however, you can override it by deselecting the checkbox and clicking apply filter . The following behaviors take place: If set to Yes, students will only show on the list page that correspond to their current admissions or enrollment year. For example, if the Student has applied to multiple years, he or she will only appear on the list page that corresponds to the most recent year that they have status and checklist history. If this option is deselected, a Student will appear on every list page in which they have a status and checklist history. For example, if a Student applied two years in a row, they will show up in both year\u2019s list page with different status and checklist history for each year. View in Search If you need to do a one-off search for something that\u2019s not in your commonly used filters such as interests, birthdate, parent or household information, etc, you can open your filtered results in the Search and Reports page by clicking on View in Search . Once the results open up in the Search and Reports page, you can add custom columns, change your reporting view, save your search or export it.

    "body": "Overview You can download and print various online forms, uploaded documents, or contact photos in bulk from list pages or search using the Download menu. Once you've selected one or more students on the page, the Download menu will become active and you can click it to see all of your options. Online Forms will have a few additional options for you to choose from before starting the download (see the section below for details) . File Upload items or Contact Photos will always bulk download as a ZIP file, containing the files for each student in their original format as uploaded by the parent/student. In this article Downloading File Uploads of Contact Photos Downloading Forms Downloading File Uploads of Contact Photos To access the download menu, first select one or more students from the search or list page. When you choose to download files from checklist items or student photos from the Download menu, the system will automatically start to prepare your file. Please remain on the page while the system processes the files for download. (It should be pretty quick.) Once ready, a download button will appear in the pop-up window. Click it to download the files or images as a Zip file. Downloading Forms Remember, to access the download menu, first select one or more students from the search or list page. Once you do that, you'll be able to expand the download menu and select the content that you'd like to download. When you select a form from within the Download menu, you'll see this pop-up window with additional options. Download Options : Download as a single PDF file : This will download all selected student's forms in a single, PDF file. Download as a ZIP file with a separate PDF for each form : This creates a separate PDF for each student\u2019s form, and it will include their name in the file name. Download as a CSV: This downloads the form data as a CSV file for use in spreadsheet software. Student names are in the first column, with each question as a column header. Note : Column headers use the canonical (or internal) field names, not the actual questions that you see on the form. Because of that, you might find it useful to open the internal view of the form in a new tab so you can look at the canonical field name and the question or prompt on the form that it's attached to. See the GIF below for a quick reference in opening the \"Show Form\" option for one of your forms. Font Size : Here you have two font size options to choose from: Standard is approximately 8pt font, while Large is approximately 10pt font. Pages to Include : If you\u2019re printing a document with multiple labeled pages, you can either print the entire document or you can select which pages you wish to print from the drop-down menu. Form Options : Here you can include page numbers, repeat the header on every page, include page breaks between each form page, and/or include the contact portrait (if available.) Please note: If you include the contract portrait, the file size will double. Generate : Once you\u2019ve set your printing options, click Generate to bulk download your forms. If you need to exit out of this menu, you can click Cancel. Please note: You will see these additional options ONLY when bulk downloading online form checklist items. Any file upload checklist items or contact photos will bulk download as a single ZIP file, containing the uploaded documents in the original format the parent/student uploaded them in the system.

    "body": "Overview Emails can be sent either individually or in bulk to manage various steps of the admissions and/or enrollment process, such as event invites, thank you notes, checklist reminders, newsletters, and more. You can send emails based on existing custom email templates that you've created, or you can create one-off emails on the fly while in the 'Send Email' process. In this article Selecting the Send Email Action Selecting Recipients Sending Family-Based Emails Scheduling an Email Editing Email Content Previewing an Email Sending an Email Visibility Permission for Emails If you've set a Permission within the email template , only admins with that permission will be able to: view or edit the template send that template to a recipient view the sent communication on the contact record, sent email page, and failed email page To add a permission level within an email template, click into the Permission Set box and select which permission(s) to apply. You can add multiple permissions or leave it blank. If you leave it blank, the email will be visible/manageable by any admin regardless of permission. For example, if you've set an email template with the Medical permission (as seen below), only admins with Medical permissions assigned to them will be able to see those emails. Admin Permissions are assigned under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Admin Portal Accounts. Permissions can be added within email templates under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates. How-To: Send Emails Selecting the Send Email Action You can send emails in bulk from most list pages, Search &amp; Reports, and the contact record. Once you have selected the contacts you wish to email, you'll click on the green Communicate menu towards the upper right and select Send Email . This will open the 'Send Email' window. Selecting Recipients On the first page of the Send Email window, you will select who you want to receive the email. There are multiple recipient options, as described below. Please note: Recipients will only receive a single email if they are in multiple groupings. For example, if you select all parents of selected contacts and primary parents of selected contacts, the primary parent will only receive the email once. Selected contacts - This will send an email to the contacts selected on the list page/search or the contact record you are currently viewing. This can be used to send emails directly to students. All parents of selected contacts - Includes anyone with a parent, mother, or father role. This means it will include any aunts, uncles, and grandparents who have these role assignments. Primary parents of selected contacts - Refers to the parent or guardian with the primary parent flag set (noted as the orange 'P' icon to the left of their name) on the student's contact record . Financially responsible parents of selected contacts - Refers to any contact with 'Financially Responsible' set to Yes within the Parent Portal Access page of the student's contact record. All parents in the primary households of selected contacts - Includes anyone with a parent, mother, or father role in the primary household only. You can review who is in the primary household for a student by visiting the Household Details page on their contact record. Mothers of selected contacts - Refers to any contact with the 'mother' relationship set. This will also include any aunts, step-parents, and grandparents who may have the 'mother' relationship set. Fathers of selected contacts - Refers to any contact with the 'father' relationship set. This will also include any uncles, step-parents, and grandparents who may have the 'father' relationship set. Consultants of selected contacts - Includes all consultants tied to the student's record. Responsible payers of selected contacts - For schools using the Billing module only. Includes anyone who is set up as a responsible payer for the student. Sending Family-Based Emails Also on the first page of the Send Email modal, after selecting your recipients, you will see that there's an additional option to send a family-based email. If you choose to send your email as a family-based email, it will only be sent once to each parent or consultant, even if they are responsible for multiple students within the selected list. Once the emails are sent, they will display in the Recent Activity / History area of the contact record for all students within that family, even though only one copy was sent to each recipient. This is a great option when sending newsletters, event invites, or other communications where you do not what the recipient to receive duplicates. Please note: If an email is sent as family-based from an individual student's contact record, the email will only be logged in that student's Recent Activity / History, not any siblings. About merge tokens and family-based emails: It is not recommended to use contact-based merge tokens in family-based emails. If you do use them, the system will choose one of the student's information at random to populate into the email. Salutations and other recipient-based merge tokens can still be used. Scheduling an Email On the second page of the Send Email modal, you can select whether you would like your message to be sent \"Immediately\" or \"On a specific date and time\". Choosing \"Immediately\" will send the email right away (after you have previewed and clicked Submit ), whereas choosing \"On a specific date and time\" will allow you to choose a specific date and time for the email to be sent. A few notes on scheduling emails: Emails must be scheduled at least one hour in the future. All scheduled times are relative to your school's time zone, as configured within Basic Setup . Scheduled times refer to when the email will be sent , and cannot guarantee the time it will be delivered . However, typically the time between send and delivery is negligible. Scheduled emails can be viewed or canceled from within Settings - Communication - Scheduled Emails . IMPORTANT: Scheduled emails can disappear from the Scheduled Emails page up to an hour before they send and are not editable or available to cancel. However, they will still be sent at the scheduled time, even though you cannot view them within that hour window. For example, If you're sending decision letters, and you schedule them to be sent at 3 PM on Friday, these emails will disappear from the scheduled emails page around 2 PM, but they will still be sent out at the scheduled time of 3 PM. Scheduled emails will be posted to the Recent Activity section of the associated contact record(s) as soon as they're scheduled. However, if you select 'Click to see details' on any of them, it will say Scheduled (and the scheduled date/time) instead of Sent. A note on system date merge fields: If you are using any of the date merge fields (e.g. \"Current Date Numerical\") in your Scheduled Emails, they will populate the date information for the day that you scheduled the email to send , not the day it actually sends out. Example: Let's say you went into Finalsite Enrollment on October 7th and scheduled an email to be sent to a family on October 10th. If you used one of the system date merge fields in the email body or subject, when the contact receives the email on October 10th, they will see the date pulled in as October 7th (when you set up the email to be sent). Editing Email Content On the third page of the Send Email modal is where you will enter the content of your email. You can either select from an existing email template or write a new email from scratch. You can also change the default reply-to email address or add other email addresses to be CC'd/BCC'd on the email. To learn more about the email editor or best practices sending email, refer to the following articles: Template Editor Email Best Practices Email HTML Limitations Using Video in Finalsite Enrollment Emails Using Images &amp; Video in Templates Previewing an Email On the final page of the Send Email modal, you will be able to preview your email before sending it. All merge tokens will be populated with the appropriate data, so you can see exactly what the recipient will see when they get that email in their inbox. When previewing an email, be sure to check for the following: Review the body of the email and the merge tokens to be sure the details are correct. Watch out for missing data. Some of the contacts may not have any data recorded in the merge fields you selected. Sending an Email After previewing your email and confirming that it looks the way you want, click the blue Submit button at the bottom of the window to complete the process and send (or schedule) the email to your selected recipients. Please note: CC and BCC emails will not appear as separate entries on the Sent Emails page . You can view the details for any individual email to see what email addresses were CC'd or BCC'd.

    "body": "Overview When crafting emails to send in Finalsite Enrollment, there are some best practices that are helpful to keep in mind to ensure that you are getting the best open and click rates, and that your emails look the best they can for your prospective and current families. This article will cover some general email best practices, but if you have any specific questions about crafting your emails in Finalsite Enrollment, our Support Team is always available to help! Click here to learn how to use the Template Editor in Finalsite Enrollment. In this Article Colors, Images, Video, &amp; Advanced HTML Formatting When to use HTML, images, and video in emails Text / Font Sizing Images in Emails Video in Emails What to always include for Admission/Enrollment emails Scheduling Emails Colors, Images, Video, &amp; Advanced HTML Formatting Should you add these items to your emails? Research by leading marketing companies, such as Hubspot, have found that highly formatted emails with lots of HTML, color, and images reduce engagement by 23% to 37% on average, and reduce click-through rates up to 51%. For more information on this research, check out this blog post by Hubspot . The reason for this reduction in engagement is that we have come to associate a highly stylized email (with images, multiple fonts, and colors) as marketing emails that may not contain personalized information or require immediate action. The best-performing emails are: Concise with clear information and a single call to action. Text only with no images, videos, stylized formatting, or header images. When to use HTML, images, and video in emails Stylized emails may still have a place in your communication plans! Newsletters, event invites and formal communication from your school may all require some level of formatting and stylization. We all want our emails to look great; however, there are some challenges when sending HTML emails, because email clients do not all support HTML in the same way and they never support the full range of HTML styles. This means that while you have full access to HTML formatting in Finalsite Enrollment, not all receiving email clients will render it the same. Text / Font Sizing Generally, we recommend using 13px font size in your emails. That translates to 10pt font size in most word editors and is the default on all templates. If you want to add a header section, we recommend 16px. Email web editors use pixels, not points for font sizes. Use the following conversion guide to figure out the best pixel size for the text/font in your emails. Pixel to Point Conversion Chart Pixel Point 11px 8pt 12px 9pt 13px 10pt 16px 12pt 18px 14pt Single Spacing The default line spacing in email templates is double, however, you can easily make a single space by holding down the shift key + enter/return on your keyboard. Images in Emails Email Width Emails are limited to 600px width. This is per industry best practices within email marketing and sending services. 600px width ensures readability on mobile devices and within many email clients. Images and tables will automatically conform to the 600px width overall, however, all images should be pre-sized to 600px width when adding them to a template (see the section on Images in Emails above). If a table cell is defined as a percentage width, it will be based on the max-width of 600px. Pre-sizing images Always pre-size your images to 600px before uploading them to Finalsite Enrollment to ensure correct visibility. Some email clients do not respect the image size HTML tag (for example, Microsoft Office), so resizing the image first will help ensure consistency of its look across the different email clients receiving the email. For more information on using images in your templates, click here . Working Smarter by uploading images to File Management As a best practice, we recommend formatting the sizing of the image on your computer and then uploading it to File Management . Images uploaded through the File Management page are available, to pull into emails when you utilize the browse option in the email template. If you were to upload the image from your computer each time you add it to a template, you'd be creating a bunch of duplicate files, which would clutter your system. Instead, if you first upload the image to File Management and then pull it into your email with the Browse option (pictured above) you'll ensure consistency and simplicity (by not duplicating the image a bunch of times in your files.) Video in Emails Most email clients do not support embedded video. However, using some of our best practices, you can still share a video with your prospective or current families through a Finalsite Enrollment email. For more information on using videos in your templates, click here . Admissions and Enrollment Parent Emails Always include a link to your Parent Portal within all emails that pertain to the checklist or items your parents need to complete. You can add this link to any template using the merge token from the 'School' category and then select 'Parent Portal URL.' If you don't want to display the full link, you can hyperlink the merge token. To do this, insert the token into the body of the email somewhere, 'cut' the merge token, and then highlight the text you'd like to hyperlink. Next, click on the hyperlink button (chain icon) and 'paste' the merge token as shown below. Include a link to the Parent Portal Help Center within your signature in email templates, and/or within the 'Contact Communication Area' template within Settings--Portal-- Parent Portal Content . If you'd like to include the portal email (if one exists) in any of your emails so that parents/guardians can see what email address they used to create their portal account, you can include it via the 'recipient' category and then select 'portal email.' {{recipient.portal_email}}. You can include a note that if none exists, it will be blank and if it's mistyped, to please call the school so you can update it within Settings--Portal--Parent Portal Accounts. Scheduling Emails With Finalsite Enrollment, you can schedule emails to be sent at a specific date and time. When to schedule an email for delivery depends on what action you want the recipient to take: If the action is a quick reply to the email: Sending it after 10AM local time is recommended. If the action may require more in-depth action: It may be recommended to send it later in the afternoon. Email has a tendency to be read and then forgotten, so optimizing your send times to when the recipient has time to sit down and take the desired action is the best practice. Research shows that email should be not be sent first thing in the morning, especially on Mondays, or late on Fridays. Transition times in the day are also not recommended. Transitions times include the end of the workday and especially Friday afternoon.

You can also select ' Click here to see details ' and a dialogue box will open showing the contents of the email, including the date it was sent and when it was opened, in a read-only (non-editable) format. -- You can find the full history of emails sent to a contact on the contact record either by: Clicking on the \u201c See full activity history \u201d link under the Recent Activity section. Or by clicking on the History page icon on the contact record. You can use the \u201c Select to show/hide \u201d icons on the History page to display only emails, by clicking the other icons off (they\u2019ll turn grey), and leaving the Email icon selected. Emails in the Sent Emails page Within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Sent Emails , you can view a log of all emails that have been sent in bulk and individually from the system. The Sent Emails page allows you to filter the data in different ways and provides additional information on each email, displayed in the columns. Please note: CC and BCC emails will not appear as separate entries on the Sent Emails page. You can view the details for any individual email to see what email addresses were CC'd or BCC'd. Date and Filter Options Date Range : This allows you to filter the results by date range. Export: Selecting this will export a file with the results of the sent emails log. Filter Options : Using the filter options on this page, you can search for particular emails by keywords in the subject, the recipient\u2019s email address, the name of the contact emailed, the contact on whose behalf it was sent, or whether or not the email was opened. When filtering whether or not an email has been opened, please note that if a parent has a privacy setting on their email provider that prevents email data from being tracked, their emails will show up within the results of unopened messages. Therefore, it is possible to have parents who have opened an email continue to show up as unopened when filtering on the Sent Emails page due to the privacy settings on their end. Column Headers and what they mean Sent On: When the email was sent. Opened On : A timestamp marking the date and time when the email was opened. The data on when the email was opened should show up almost instantly on your Sent Emails page as soon as the email has been opened by the recipient. Please note : Some email providers allow tracking prevention to be enabled. If a user has a feature like this enabled, the data regarding when an email was opened will not be displayed. Clicked On: A timestamp indicating the exact date and time when a link within the email is first clicked. This means that if there are any links in the email, the timestamp will show the date and time when a parent clicks on one of these links for the first time. Receiver Email: The email address of the person who received the email. Subject: The subject of the email. Sent : A read-only (non-editable) checkbox to denote that the email was sent. Contact Emailed : The name of the individual who was sent the email. On Behalf of: The student associated with that individual through the contact record. Additional Options Show : Click on ' show ' to view the email that was sent in a read-only (non-editable) mode. Resend : Click on ' resend ,' and you can resend the email. Please note that you cannot edit the contents of the email or the recipient's email address. Clicking resend will resend the email without a preview screen.

    "body": "Overview If an email sent through Finalsite Enrollment fails for some reason, it will end up in the Failed Emails section of the site for you to review. This allows you to view a detailed list of which emails failed to send, along with the failure reasons. How-To: Review Failed Emails To access this page, go to Settings - Communication - Failed Emails . Here, you can view a log of all emails that failed to successfully send from within the Finalsite Enrollment system. You can apply Filter Options to search for an email by subject, email address, or contact name. Visibility Permission for Emails If you've set a Permission within the email template , only admins with that permission will be able to: view or edit the template send that template to a recipient view the sent communication on the contact record, sent email page, and failed email page To add a permission level within an email template, click into the Permission Set box and select which permission(s) to apply. You can add multiple permissions or leave it blank. If you leave it blank, the email will be visible/manageable by any admin regardless of permission. For example, if you've set an email template with the Medical permission (as seen below), only admins with Medical permissions assigned to them will be able to see those emails. Admin Permissions are assigned under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Admin Portal Accounts. Permissions can be added within email templates under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates. Within the Failed Emails page, you will see the following columns: Sent At: The date that the email was sent. To: This is the email address that the email was sent to. Subject: This is the subject line of the email. Failure Reason: This is the reason an email was not sent to or received by the recipient. See the section on Failure Reasons below for some specific examples. Contact: The name of the contact to whom you sent the email. You also have access to a few different actions along the right side of the page: Show: This action will open a read-only view of the email that you tried to send. It also allows you to see the full text of the Failure Reason. Ignore: This action will remove the failed email from the list. In addition to ignoring individual emails, you can bulk ignore all of your failed emails. See the section on Bulk Ignore below for details. Resend: This action will attempt to resend the email. Please note: No edits can be made (to the email message or recipient email address) before resending. Bulk Ignore If you have a backlog of failed emails that you want to clear out, you can click the green Ignore All button towards the upper right of the page. You will be prompted to confirm the action. This action will ignore all failed emails across all pages (not just the page you are currently viewing) and cannot be reversed. How-To: Understand Failure Reasons Some examples of reasons that emails can fail include: Inactive email address Mailbox is full A user marked one of your emails as spam and can\u2019t receive any more as a result. The recipient would need to go into their spam settings to mark the email as not spam or add your Finalsite Enrollment domain to their email allow list (whitelisting them). Whitelisting emails prevents them from going to Spam. Here's a great resource on how to whitelist emails from Hubspot. A hard bounce means an email address does not exist. It could be the user doesn\u2019t exist or the domain doesn\u2019t exist. This could be due to a misspelling or perhaps that person is no longer at that company/school/etc. Hard bounces are saying the destination server can\u2019t recognize the recipient. A soft bounce means a recipient exists but there is an issue with the mailbox or message such as mailbox full, recipient email server is down or offline, or the email message is too large.

    "body": "Overview Different types of contacts are defined within the system through roles and statuses . In this article, we will explore the various roles and statuses that you will see in Finalsite Enrollment, as well as explain how they affect the Parent Portal view. In this Article Roles In Workflow Roles Out of Workflow Roles Statuses Inquiry Applicant Application Complete Accepted Enrollment Enrolled Roles The Role within Finalsite Enrollment defines the type of contact record you are viewing - for example, if the record is for a student in admissions or a parent. The most common roles are set automatically by the system as a contact moves through the workflow. Roles in the system are categorized into In Workflow roles and Out of Workflow roles. A record can have more than one role. For example, a Student who is also in Enrollment. In Workflow Roles In Workflow includes all of the roles within the Admissions Funnel , from the Inquiry stage up to Enrollment. In workflow roles include: Inquiry: A contact with a status of Inquiry or Inquiry Completed. Applicant: A contact with a status of Application, Application Complete, Accepted, or an active custom applicant status . Enrollment: A contact with a status of Enrollment in Progress, Enrolled, or an active custom enrollment status . Student: A student currently enrolled at your school. Legacy: The Legacy Role is used to flag children in admissions or enrollment (except returning enrolled students) that have an alumni parent, a sibling that is currently enrolled at the school, or a sibling that previously attended the school. Read more about the Legacy role within this article: Legacy Role. Out of Workflow Roles Out of Workflow includes anyone outside of the Admissions Funnel , such as prospects, parents, and alumni. Out of workflow roles include: Former Student: A formerly enrolled student who did not graduate from your school. Those marked as Former students will no longer be visible in a Parent's portal/checklist. Alumni: A graduate of your school. Graduating students will be marked as Alumni (unless otherwise noted within Settings - General - Grades ). Graduates who are marked as alumni will no longer be visible in a Parent's portal/checklist. Parent: A parent of any student contact in the system. Lead: A parent of a prospect. This is auto-assigned to parents when they are imported through a CMS Leadflow form. Read more about these in our Finalsite Leadflow article. Consultant : A representative/agent for a family applying or enrolling at your school, most commonly for international students. Prospect : A student that you may not have a relationship with yet, but is a potential candidate such as a church feeder school list, a public school list, or a younger sibling of a current student. What's the difference between a Lead and a Prospect? Leads and Parents are both considered Roles in Finalsite Enrollment. A role defines the type of contact in the system. For example, the role of \"Parent\" identifies anyone in the system who is a parent. The main difference between a Lead and a Prospect is that a Lead is a Parent while a Prospect is a Student. Leads represent parents that have been added to Finasite Enrollment through a Leadflow Form. Prospects can be students brought over from a Leadflow form, but they can also be imported into your site or added through the Quick Action menu. Statuses The Status within Finalsite Enrollment is the relative position within the role. Only in-workflow contacts can be assigned a status. A Note on Status Automation: Some statuses are automatically assigned, either by a form being submitted or all required items on a checklist being completed. These statuses have been marked with an asterisk* below. Any other statuses must be manually set. Custom Statuses Custom statuses can be created for both the Admissions and Enrollment processes. Please note: Custom enrollment statuses will not be displayed in the Enrollment Report; however, they will be included in your counts and the respective stages in the Admissions Funnel and Admissions Report. Custom statuses are also admin-facing only and not viewable in the Parent Portal. Click here to learn more, including how to create your own custom statuses. Below is a list of each role and the statuses that fall within each role. We recommend you use them as described. Inquiry Inquiry statuses are admin-facing only, as parents have not created a Parent Portal Account yet at this stage. This means that the associated inquiry checklist is also admin-facing only. Inquiry statuses include: Inquiry* : A contact who has submitted an inquiry form. Viewable by: Admin only. Inquiry Completed*: A contact who has all required inquiry checklist items marked as complete. This status change happens automatically once the last required checklist item is marked complete. As a reminder, families do not have access to the Inquiry checklist so these items that are marked as complete are from the Admin side of things. Viewable by: Admin only. Inactive Inquiry: This is not an automatic status. It has to be manually applied to a student. Using a status like 'Inactive Inquiry' will enable you to focus outreach on genuinely interested prospective students, rather than maintaining a large pool of inactive inquiries who might not have been interested initially. This approach ensures cleaner data and prevents unnecessary inflation of your sales funnel. Applicant Some applicant statuses are parent-facing, while others are admin-facing only. Within the applicant stage, parents will have a Parent Portal Account created and be able to access their student's checklist. Applicant statuses include: Applicant*: A contact who has submitted an application form, but has not yet completed their application checklist. Viewable by: Parent/Guardian. The following type of message will display underneath the student's name in the Portal: \" Applying for X Grade in [Term]\". Important Note about Applicants who also Inquired: In some cases, you may have Application forms in your inbox that need to be merged or imported as new contacts. This often happens when a family first inquires with your school via the Inquiry Form, through a public calendar sign-up, or from an Admin-entered Inquiry Form and then later applies to your school. Depending on the information provided in both forms, you may be asked to confirm if these contacts are a match so that you don't have duplicate records in the system. If an Application Form is waiting to be imported into your Forms Inbox (indicated by the red number in your Username menu), the checklist within the Parent Portal will display the following message: This means you need to locate the form within the Admissions tab--Forms--Forms Inbox and confirm or deny the potential match. This will import the form and build the checklist within the Parent Portal. Application Withdrawn: A contact who has contacted the school to withdraw their application. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents still see the checklist and the \" Applying for X Grade in [Term] \" message. Deferred: A contact who has decided to wait until a future year to complete the application process. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents still see the checklist and the \" Applying for X Grade in [Term] \" message. Application Complete Application Complete statuses should be used for students who have completed all required items on their admissions checklist. Application Complete statuses include: Application Complete*: A contact who has all required admissions checklist items marked as complete. Viewable by: Parent/Guardian. The parent will see the following message in the Parent Portal: \" Thank you! Your application process is complete! \" They still have access to their checklist and any uploaded forms. Please Note: Application Complete If a student is manually assigned to the 'Application Complete' status but still has pending checklist items, the parent/guardian will not encounter the thank-you message. Instead, they will continue to see the 'Applying for X Grade in [Term]' message. If a required checklist item is added or removed after the student has already transitioned to the Applicant status, the system will not automatically update their status to Application Complete . In such instances, you will need to manually change their status to Application Completed. This is because the system looks for the required items at the time the student becomes an applicant to establish the Application Complete status Review in Progress*: A contact who is currently being reviewed for admission by your reader committee . The change to Review in Progress will happen automatically once at least one reader is assigned to the student. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents still see the checklist and the \" Applying for X Grade in [Term] \" message. Waitlisted: A contact who has completed all required admissions checklist items, but is on the waitlist to be offered a spot at your school. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents still see the checklist and the \" Applying for X Grade in [Term] \" message. Denied: A contact who has completed all required admissions checklist items, but to whom you will not be offering admission. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents still see the checklist and the \" Applying for X Grade in [Term] \" message. Accepted Accepted statuses should be used for students to whom you have extended an offer (or plan to extend an offer) of admission to your school. Accepted statuses are NOT visible to parents through the Parent Portal. Accepted statuses include: Accepted: A contact who has completed the application and review process, and has been accepted to your school. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents see the application complete message and can still access their admissions checklist. Did Not Enroll: A contact who was accepted to your school, but you could not reconnect with to enroll. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents see the application complete message and can still access their admissions checklist. Parent Declined: A contact who was accepted to your school, but whose parents declined to enroll. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents see the application complete message and can still access their admissions checklist. Enrollment Enrollment statuses are used for both new students enrolling for the first time in your school, as well as returning students enrolling for a new school year. Enrollment statuses include: Enrollment in Progress: A contact who is in the process of enrolling in your school (either for the first time or for a new year). Viewable by: Parent/Guardian. Once new and returning students have a status of enrollment in progress, the enrollment checklist becomes visible on the Parent Portal, although contracts will not be viewable until you generate them. Parents will see the following message: \"Enrolling for X Grade in [Term]\". Please note: For returning students, the change to Enrollment in Progress is automatic after you complete the rollover process . For new students, this status change will require manually moving accepted students to enrollment (which can be done in bulk). Academic Hold: A contact whose enrollment process is on hold for academic reasons. Viewable by: Parent/Guardian. This status is displayed within the Parent Portal with the following message: \"Account is on hold. Please contact us for details.\" The type of hold is not indicated to the parent. The parent will not be able to access the student's checklist or complete items until the hold is removed. Financial Hold: A contact whose enrollment process is on hold for financial reasons. Viewable by: Parent/Guardian. This status is displayed within the Parent Portal with the following message: \"Account is on hold. Please contact us for details.\" The type of hold is not indicated to the parent. The parent will not be able to access the student's checklist or complete items until the hold is removed. Not Enrolling: A contact who determined during the enrollment process that they are no longer enrolling. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents/Guardians will no longer see the student in the portal and the checklist is no longer available. The role of ' Former Student ' is automatically assigned to the contact when they are placed in this status. Enrolled Enrolled*: A contact who has all required enrollment checklist items marked as complete and is considered enrolled at your school. This status change happens automatically once the last required enrollment checklist item is marked complete. Viewable by: Parent/Guardian. The parent will see the following message in the Parent Portal: \"Thank you! Your enrollment process is complete.\" They still have access to their checklist and any uploaded forms. Please note: If the student is manually placed in Enrolled but still has pending checklist items to complete, the parent/guardian will not see the thank you message, and will instead still see the \" Enrolling for X Grade in [Term] \" message. Mid-Year Withdrawal: A contact who enrolled at your school, but decided partway through to withdraw their enrollment. Viewable by: Admin only. Parents/Guardians will no longer see the student in the portal and the checklist is no longer available. The role of ' Former Student ' is automatically assigned to the contact when they are placed in this status.

Allow Users To Stay Logged In: Check this box if you want to allow users to select the \"Remember Me\" checkbox when they login to Finalsite Enrollment. The Remember Me checkbox allows them to stay logged in for two weeks. When not enabled, users will automatically log out after 30 minutes of inactivity. Please note: This option is not available when using Google SSO . Parent Portal New app caption: Caption that displays in a larger font at the top of the Parent Portal when a parent is filling out a new application form. File Upload Options The size limit in MB: Maximum size (in MB) allowed for file uploads on the student checklist. Please note : This size limit applies to files uploaded from the parent portal and the admin portal and the maximum allowed file size is 1000MB. A limit of 5-10 MB should be sufficient for uploading the majority of documents and image files. You may need to increase it for larger files, such as videos. At this time, limits cannot be set per checklist item. Facebook Domain Verification If your school is using Facebook Domain Manager for marketing purposes, you'll need to retrieve your unique meta tag from Facebook Business Manager. Here's how to get your meta tag from Facebook: In Facebook Business Manager, go to Business Settings &gt; Brand safety &gt; Domains. Click Add, then + Create a new domain. Click on the Meta Tag Verification tab and copy your meta tag code. Please input the verification code only. For example, if the meta tag is &lt;meta name=\"facebook-domain-verification\" content=\"abc123\"/&gt; please enter abc123 into this field.

Read below to learn how. Process After filtering out a specific list of contacts, you can then perform the following bulk edits, which are described in more detail below. Add a note or activity Change status Update checklist Update a field Remove from term Change current term Manage readers Add a Note or Activity The first option in the edit menu is to Add a Note or Activity in bulk. A window will open up so that you can add just a note, just an activity, or both. You can: Add text for your note Select an activity Pick a date for your activity Choose who it\u2019s visible to. Once you set your preferences, click Next to apply your changes. Change Status You can also change statuses in bulk within the Edit menu. In the dialogue box that opens, choose the status you need to update your selected contacts to, such as Accepted (1) as shown below. Click on Next (2) to apply the change. The system will notify you how many contacts will be updated with this change and you can click save to confirm. Update Checklist You can also update checklist items in bulk and mark them off as complete or incomplete by clicking on Edit \u2013 Update Checklist . Within the dialogue box, you can: Check or uncheck an item Select the checklist type Select the checklist items(s) you wish to update Click Next to apply the changes Update a Field The edit menu makes updating fields in bulk easy. If there\u2019s any field in your system that you\u2019d like to update for a group of selected contacts in bulk, you can click on Edit \u2013 Update a Field. Here you can view a comprehensive list of all fields in your system from the Field (1) drop down menu. Select or search for a field you\u2019d like to update by typing in the text box. Next you\u2019ll have an option to update the field (2) using either a blank text box, a drop down menu, or a list of options to check off. You may need to update the reach out method for a group of Inquiries as shown below. You can also update scholarship amounts, financial aid, and tuition override amounts which are particularly useful during the enrollment season. Once you\u2019ve made your updates, click on Next (3) to apply the changes. Remove From Term If you need to remove any contacts from the current term that\u2019s set for the page you\u2019re working in, select remove from term from the bulk edit menu . The system will let you know that all of the selected contacts will change to a \u201cnot in workflow\u201d status for that term. Click remove to confirm this action. Change Current Term Change current term is ONLY available in the Admissions List page (not in the Enrollment List Page as there is a bulk rollover feature for your returning students) and within the Edit menu of a child's record. This feature allows you to perform two actions as described below. The steps are as follows: Select which action you\u2019d like to perform. Copy: Selecting this option will copy the current admissions data to a new term that you select in the drop down menu, and the admissions data for the current term will remain. This action will also automatically increment the grade for the selected contacts based on the promotion rules set on your Grades page. Checklist answers will be cleared out by default for the new term they get copied over to. If you\u2019d like to retain the checklist items, you will need to copy each contact over individually within the student record. Move: Selecting this option will move the current admissions data to a new term that you select in the drop down menu, and the admissions data for the current term will be DELETED. With this action, only the term will be updated. The grade, checklist completion, and all other data for the selected contacts will remain unchanged. If you need to update the grades of the selected contacts, you can manually edit the grade for each student within their student records. Select the term you wish to copy or move the selected contacts to from the drop down menu. Select the new status for the selected contacts from the drop down menu. Once both of these fields are set, click ' submit ' to apply your changes. **IMPORTANT BEHAVIORS: If you copy a term to a year where there is a pre-existing term, the checklist will merge together, instead of clearing out the data. The common use case is this: Student is an applicant for 2019-2020. Parent inquires for 2020-2021. Admin may overlook the import helper text, so they import the applicant to the 2020-2021 term. Result: The student has a blank applicant checklist now for 2020. Admin moves the student back to 2019-2020. The checklist is merged so that if any checklist items were already checked off in the 2019 year, they remain checked off. The only way checklist items are copied around is if the checklist item spans multiple years. If the checklist item only exists in a single year, we don\u2019t copy / move those answers. This is important because it is more common that enrollment checklist items only exist one year at a time. The contract and deposit checklist item are never moved or copied. There is a significant amount of data associated with the contract and deposit. Moving and copying these items causes a lot of side effects, especially with our Billing module. As per the behavior noted above, these items won't be cleared out if you move the child one year back on top of an existing year with answers. How to clear out individual checklist items for specific contacts. If you need to clear out and/or maintain the completion status of different checklist items on a per child basis, you can do so within the contact record. Click on the Edit menu--Change Current Term. This is a 3 step process which allows you to keep or clear checklist items as needed. Click here to learn more. Manage Readers Manage Readers lets you assign and remove Readers to students in the review process when using the Review Module. Select the action (assign or remove) you wish to perform. Type in the name(s) of the Readers you\u2019d like to assign to the selected students within the Admissions List Page. Click save to submit your changes and to notify the readers via email if they\u2019ve been assigned students to review or if they\u2019ve had students removed.",

    "body": "Overview Terms in Finalsite Enrollment refer to the periods in which students apply and enroll. These are typically school years (e.g. 2021-2022), but some schools may have programs that are longer or shorter in duration. A Note on Term-Based Fields Some fields in Finalsite Enrollment are term-based, which means they can store unique data per term that the student is in for admissions or enrollment - click here for the full list. Non-term-based fields, especially those that drive tuition and fees, will need to be cleared out each year . How-To: Manage Terms &amp; Settings Access the Terms setup page by navigating to 'Settings' - 'General' - 'Terms'. Within this page, you have access to a few different settings, as described below. * Add a New Term * Click the green ' Add a New Term' button in the upper left to create a new term (school year) in your site. You will be required to enter a name (how the term will display throughout the system) as well as a start year for the new term being added. You can follow the format of the existing terms in your site as a reference. To confirm adding the new term, click the blue 'Submit' button. * Edit Existing Terms * You can change the name or start year for any existing terms by clicking on the blue pencil icon in the rightmost column. Please note: If you are using the FACTS Integration , it is very important that your term names in Finalsite Enrollment match what is in FACTS. Changing the name could cause errors. * Default Year for Reporting * Within the 'Default for Reporting' drop-down menu, you can select the term that you want to use as the default on all list pages (admissions and enrollment), searches, and reports. You will still be able to view other terms using filter options. We recommend using the current school year as your default. This can be changed at any time. * Terms Available on Inquiry / Application Forms * You can manage which Terms will appear to families on your inquiry form and application form by toggling the buttons underneath the Available on Inquiry Forms and Available on Application Forms headers. These two options can be set separately, which is useful in cases where you want to allow families to inquire about a future term, but you don't want to open applications for that term just yet. Changes will be saved automatically.As a best practice, switch off any old years and stay up to date with current and future years for your forms. Please note: If you are logged in as an Admin/User, you will be able to view ALL past terms when filling out an inquiry or application. However, parents/students will only see the terms that are toggled to 'Yes' on the Terms setup page. Now that the Terms have been set up, you can review the checklists and forms associated with each term (within 'Settings' - 'Checklists') to ensure these items are up-to-date for any newly created or activated school years. Click here for more information. How-To: Use the Data Management Tool The Data Management tool lets you manage which checklist item data and/or review data you would like to permanently delete for a selected term (school year). This is useful for schools that want to purge their system of certain forms and uploaded documents year-over-year or for schools that want to clear our review data from prior years for re-applicants. Please note: The Data Management column on the Terms setup page is only visible to System Admins . This column will not display for Admins, Users, or Limited Users. To use the Data Management tool, follow these steps: 1. Click on the red pencil button next to the term from which you want to delete data. 2. The ' Manage Data Retention' window will appear.Check off the boxes for all items you wish to permanently delete. 3. Click the blue ' Confirm ' button at the bottom. 4. To complete the process, you will be asked to confirm that you understand this data will be permanently deleted and cannot be recovered . Type the word ' DELETE ' into the box, and then click on the blue 'Submit' button (which will only become available once the word is typed) to confirm the action. Data Management Audit History To see an audit history of all deleted data, click on the blue book icon next to the ' Data Management ' column header. In the audit log, you can view a history of all times the data management tool has been used, including when it was run, the term, the name of the user that completed the action, whether review data was removed or not, and which checklist items were deleted.

    "body": "Overview Term-based fields are fields within the system that contain historical data based on the term selected for the page you\u2019re working on within Finalsite Enrollment. These fields hold unique sets of data for each academic year. These fields will be cleared once a new term has been activated for a contact . This includes: An applicant that applies for a new term. Activating the new enrollment year for your enrolling students/performing rollover. For both situations above, data from previous years will still be maintained. Any fields outside of the ones listed below will require a manual reset each year, unless they are custom term-based fields . For more information on custom term-based fields, read on below. Click here to learn more about non-term-based fields and how to clear them. List of Standard Term-Based Fields Below is a full list of the term-based fields that store data per term and will reset/clear out automatically each year: grade_id apply_year_id apply_grade_id (same as grade_id) enroll_grade_id (same as grade_id) status enrollment_type waitlist_position role deposit_amount_paid deposit_payment_method tuition_override deposit_override application_fee_waiver financial_aid_amount financial_aid_request financial_aid_amount_request financial_aid_status scholarship_amount scholarship_status application_submit_date inquiry_submit_date contract_submit_date application_fee_paid application_fee_method entry_date &amp; exit_date contract_state Custom Term-Based Fields When creating or editing a custom field, you have the option to designate it as term-based by selecting the \" Term-based \" checkbox. Just like the standard term-based fields referenced above, when a custom field is designated as term-based, it will hold unique a set of data for each academic year. To make a field \" Term-based \" go to ' Settings--Fields &amp; Data--Fields .' Select edit next to the field and mark the checkbox for \"Term-based\" and select \"Submit\". When working with custom term-based fields, there are a few important things to keep in mind: You can NOT remove the term-based designation from a field. Once it has been configured as term-based, it must remain that way. Existing custom fields CAN be changed to term-based. If you change an existing field to term-based, the current value for any student that has data in the field will be copied to every term for which the student has data. You can then change data for each past term as needed. In Search, the field will only display data for the selected term. If you want to view historical data for the field, you will need to update the term. Any field that is designated as term-based will NOT carry data forward to the next term. Any existing standard fields (like email, name, relationship, etc.) can NOT be made term-based ID Fields can NOT be made term-based Term based fields may only be mapped to the student as parents and other entities do not have a term. What happens when I copy or move a child to a different term? When moving or copying a record between terms, we will copy data in ALL term-based fields (standard and custom) into the new term (whether moving forward or backward). Need Help? If you are unsure of the best way to utilize the custom term-based field functionality, please consult with our Support team who would be happy to review your needs and come up with the best solution.

    "body": "These bulk actions are only available within the Enrollment Module Generate Contracts Once your new and returning students have a status of Enrollment in Progress, you can then generate contracts in bulk. You may want to set some filters first for a status of Enrollment in Progress, a contract status of pending, and then you can filter for new or returning students if you wish. Once you apply your filters, select all of your contacts in bulk, click on the bulk edit menu and then select Generate Contracts . You\u2019ll be notified how many contracts will be generated within the contacts you selected. In addition, you\u2019ll be notified what contacts already submitted contracts so that you know they will not be re-generated. Once everything looks okay to you, click on \u201c Generate .\u201d Roll-Over Rollover for your returning students can be performed in bulk and is only accessible via the edit menu of your enrolled students page . Please note, roll-over is specific to enrollment only and does not apply to Inquiries or Applicants . For these students, you can use Change Current Term within the Edit menu of the Admissions List Page or individually within the student record. Please refer to the Terms: Student Record Features article for more information. As soon as a student becomes enrolled, they will show up in the Enrolled Students page. You can now look back at class rosters for previous years by selecting the Term in the top left of the page. When it comes to your current class roster, you can roll students over to the following grade in bulk and they\u2019ll automatically show up in the Students in Enrollment List Page with a status of Enrollment in Progress for you to manage them. To do this, select your students within the Enrolled Students list page and click on Edit \u2013 Rollover to new term . This bulk tool promotes students based on their grade\u2019s promotion order. If students already exist in the new Term, then there\u2019s no need to roll them over. Students can be rolled-over individually or in bulk, and can be rolled over all at once or at different times. (To manage promotion or advancement order for each grade, go to Settings \u2013 General \u2013 Grades ). Once you select roll-over, a pop-up box will display letting you know what actions will take place once you perform this action as shown below. Students will be promoted from their current grade to the next grade according to the Grade Advancement Settings. Ex. 4th grade students in 2015 will be rolled over to Enrollment in Progress for 5th grade in 2016.For a school that doesn\u2019t have clearly defined grades:You might have programs where students are in multiple years in a row. In these cases, you may not have a promotion order setup if the student is in the same program 2 or 3 years consecutively. All returning students will be promoted to the new grade and have an enrollment type of Returning. Graduating students will be marked as Alumni unless otherwise noted within the Grade Advancement settings. Alumni is an \"Out of Workflow\" role and graduates who are marked as alumni will no longer be visible in a Parent's portal/checklist. Mid-Year Withdrawal students will be marked as Former Students. Students that are rolled-over have an updated status and enrollment type. All term-based fields such as deposit, financial aid, scholarship, etc will also get setup for the new year so that you can track historical payment and fee amounts for each student. If a student was previously rolled-over, the roll-over tool will ignore a second roll-over, which is a safeguard against duplicating this action. If a student is repeating a grade or skipping a grade, you can roll them forward and then manually update their grade accordingly. If a student left your school for a few years and came back, you can modify the status of that student to either new or returning once they come back to your school. Once you click the Proceed with Rollover button in blue, the system lets you know this action can\u2019t be undone and asks you to confirm. Roll-over takes a few minutes. You will then be able to see your students after the roll-over is complete within the Students in Enrollment List Page . If you need to place any students on Academic Hold , Financial Hold , or in a Deferred Status , you can update their status in bulk within Edit \u2013 Change Status or you can change statuses individually within the Edit menu of the student record. Please remember to repeat this action for any remaining pages of students.",

    "body": "Overview The File Manager within Finalsite Enrollment replaces the need to rely on external services for hosting files such as logos, infographics, checklist documents, background images, and more. You can think of it as a digital file dropbox within Finalsite Enrollment! It can be accessed from 'Settings' &gt; 'General' &gt; 'File Management' on your Finalsite Enrollment site. How-To: Use the File Management Page Supported File Types/Sizes File Types All common file types as well as a few less common file types that we've tested have been uploaded and accessed without issue. File Upload Size The file upload size is determined by the file upload limits you have set within Settings &gt; General &gt; Basic Setup &gt; File Upload Options. The size limit set here is for file management uploads and checklist item uploads. Uploading a New File Once on the File Management page, you can click on the green Upload New File button towards the top of the page to select the desired file from your computer. The file will be uploaded with the same name it has on your computer (e.g. Record_Request_Form.pdf). You can click Edit to the right of the uploaded file and change the Display Name to make it easier to find. Changing the display name does not affect the URL of the file, so you will not need to update any links after changing it. For all uploaded files, you will see a link in the Public Link column. You can click on it to download the file. To copy the link to use elsewhere, the best way is to right-click on it and select 'Copy Link Address'. Editing an Existing File If you want to upload a different version for any of your existing files, you can do so by opening the Edit menu. From here, click the option to Replace File and select the new file from your computer. Click on Submit to confirm the change. The benefit of editing the existing upload is that it does not affect the original file's URL. This means that you can easily upload updated versions of your forms each year (or as needed), and you will not need to go update links throughout your Finalsite Enrollment site. Deleting a File To delete any of your uploaded files, click on the Delete button to the right of the file. A confirmation window will appear asking you to confirm that you want to delete the file. Please note: Deleting files from File Management is permanent. There is no way to recover deleted files. How-To: Link to Files in File Management Files uploaded to File Management can be linked in email templates, checklist parent explanations, and even online forms. First, you will want to copy the public link from the File Management page in your Finalsite Enrollment site. As mentioned above, the best way to do this is to right-click on it and select 'Copy Link Address'. Once you have the link copied, follow the instructions below to add it to other areas of your Finalsite Enrollment site. For email templates: In the edit window for your email template, click on the 'Insert Link' icon in the toolbar. This icon looks like a chainlink. In the box that pops up, paste the link you copied from File Management into the URL box. In the Text box, enter whatever word(s) you would like to be displayed. If you want the link to open in a new window or tab, check the Open in new tab checkbox. Once everything is set, click Insert to drop the new hyperlink into the template. For checklist parent explanations, online forms, and code view on emails: To create a link in these areas of the Finalsite Enrollment, you will need to use some HTML formatting. You will customize it based on the link and text you want to include; however, the basic format is: &lt;a href=\"[URL]\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"&gt;Click here to download the file.&lt;/a&gt; You will replace the [URL] in the above example with the link you copied from File Management. Make sure that it is still contained within the quotation marks. Anything contained within the tags will become a clickable link, and you can customize the surrounding text as you like. The target=\"_blank\" attribute ensures that the link will open in a new window or tab. Here is an example of what adding a link looks like when setting up a checklist parent explanation from the admin side: Here is that same example checklist item when viewed from the Parent Portal side: Parents can then click on the blue 'Click here' text to download the file.

Billing Statement (for Billing Module only) : Customize the billing statement that is automatically sent to financially responsible contacts to include your school banner, additional merge fields , etc. Click here to learn about the automated billing emails that link to the 'Billing Statement' letter template. How-To: Create or Edit a Letter Template You can access and manage all of your letter templates from Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Letter Templates. On this page, you will see a list of all of your existing letter templates with the option to take the following actions: Please note: System default templates like the Billing and Tax Statements cannot be copied or deleted. Create a new letter template: Click on the ' Add a new Letter Template ' button above your list of templates. Copy an existing letter template: Click on the ' Copy' button to the right of the template you want to copy. This will open the template editor with a copy of the existing template. You can then make changes and input a name to save it as a new template. This is also useful if you want to save a default letter template containing your school's logo/header and any signature blocks so that you can always copy from it for new templates. Edit or delete an existing letter template: Click on the ' Edit' or ' Delete' button to the right of the template you want to edit or delete. Adding, editing, or copying a letter template will bring up the ' Edit Template' window. Within this window, you have access to the following options: Name: Set a name for or rename the template. This is the name that you will see in your list of letter templates. They are organized alphabetically. Tag your template. Within the ' Tags ' field, you can create or select a tag to attach to the template. Tags are an internal-only way of organizing your communication templates. Please note: System default templates like the Billing and Tax Statements can not be tagged. You can add and remove tags in bulk within this page via the edit menu. You must select one or more templates before the ' Edit ' menu becomes available. You can read more about how to manage tags here . Margins: Set the desired margins, in inches, for your letter. Compose your letter: You can type directly into the text box or use the merge token picker to pull in dynamic data from the system. You also have access to the full range of formatting options, such as adding bold text or images. Click here to learn more about the Template Editor options! Please note: The recipient category of merge fields does not work in letters because only a single PDF is generated. However, you can still populate a parent's name in a letter template by using a merge field such as {{contact.parent1.name}}. Click here for more information. Close: This will close the window without saving your changes. Save: This will save your changes. Be sure to click this button when you create your template or make your desired edits! Unsaved templates or changes cannot be recovered. Unlike email templates, letter templates cannot be changed on the fly while generating them for students. Letter templates can ONLY be edited under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Letter Templates , so if you need to make changes, you will need to do so from this page before starting the process of generating the letters for students. Filter Options and Edit Menu Filter Options Within the Letter Template page, you can use the filter options to search for specific tags or filter the page by letter template name. You can also filter by Blank to see any custom template that doesn\u2019t yet have a tag. Reminder: You can only add Tags to custom Letter Templates. Using Filter by Name allows you to search for templates based on their name. Edit You can use the Edit Menu to add or delete tags in bulk. You must select one or more tags before the edit menu becomes available. How-To: Add a Page Break for Printing If you need an intentional printing page break to your letters, open the template, switch to code view (the &lt;/&gt; icon in the toolbar) , and add this line within the opening paragraph tag where the print page break should occur: style=\"page-break-before: always\" For example, your coding might look something like this: &lt;p style=\"page-break-before: always;\"&gt;This is an example of a paragraph.&lt;/p&gt; How-To: Reference Additional Parents or Households If you need to pull information for PARENT3, PARENT4, or HOUSEHOLD2 into a letter template, you can do so using merge fields/tokens with the following formats: For PARENT3: {{contact.parent3. FieldName }} Example: {{contact.parent3.first_name}} to pull the first name of the student's PARENT3. For PARENT4: {{contact.parent4. FieldName }} Example: {{contact.parent4.phone_1_number}} to pull the number from the phone_1 field for the student's PARENT4. For HOUSEHOLD2: {{contact.household2. FieldName }} Example: {{contact.household2.address_address_1}} to pull the Address 1 line from the address field for the student's HOUSEHOLD2.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment uses the template language Liquid , created by Shopify , which is designed for quickly developing dynamic content. Designed for accessibility by non-programmers, it allows users to create basic, easy-to-read statements that when evaluated, display certain data based on if / else statements. Below is a subset of the documentation with the most common examples schools may look to use. For more documentation, please visit: https://shopify.github.io/liquid/ If you ever need help working with Liquid, contact our Support Team . If you never learn to use it, that is okay too! Just be aware that it exists and enables highly dynamic and personalized content to be placed in your forms, emails, and letter templates. It can also be used to create custom content in the parent portal or display information on contact records. How-To: Understand the Basics of Liquid Using If / Else Statements if / else statements should be familiar to you if you have used other programming languages. They can be used to display certain content if and when the designated conditions are true for a contact. Liquid implements them with the following tags. If Statement Structure: {% if %} ... {% endif %} Usage: Encloses a section of the template which will only be run if the condition is true. Example: {% if contact.grade == '9th' %}Attend our Freshmen Welcome Event!{% endif %} In this example, the text \"Attend our Freshmen Welcome Event!\" will only appear for contacts whose grade is set to 9th. -- Elsif Statement Structure: {% elsif %} Usage: Can optionally be used within an if \u2026 endif block (see above) to specify another condition. In other words, if the initial If Statement fails, Liquid tries the Elsif Statement and runs the following section of the template if it succeeds. You can use any number of elsifs in an ifblock. Example: {% if contact.phone_1_type == 'Cell' %} {{contact.phone_1_number}} {% elsif contact.phone_2_type == 'Cell' %} {{contact.phone_2_number}} {% endif%} In this example, we're checking if the phone type for the Phone 1 field is 'Cell'. If it is, we're outputting the Phone 1 Number. If it isn't, we'll then check the Phone 2 field against the same criteria. -- Else Statement Structure: {% else %} Usage: Can optionally be used within an if \u2026 endif block, after any elsif tags. If all preceding conditions fail, Liquid will run the section of the template following the else tag. Example: {% if contact.school_level == 'UPPER' %}Attend our Upper School Preview!{% else %}Attend our Lower &amp; Middle School Preview!{% endif %} In this example, if the contact meets the criteria of school_level being 'UPPER', the text \"Attend our Upper School Preview!\" will appear. If the contact does not meet that criteria (i.e. if their school_level is anything else ), the text \"Attend our Lower &amp; Middle School Preview!\" will appear. Conditions &amp; Operators The condition of an if , elsif , or else tag should be either a normal Liquid expression or a comparison using Liquid expressions. The available comparison operators are: Operator Meaning Example == value equals contact.grade == '9th' != value does not equal contact.sport_interest != blank The available Boolean operators are: Operator Meaning Example and combining two criteria contact.grade == '9th' and contact.enrollment_type == 'new' or evaluating any two or more criteria contact.grade == '10th' or contact.grade == '11th' Please note that you cannot use parentheses to control the order of operations, and the precedence of the operators appears to be unspecified. So, when in doubt, use nested \u201cif\u201d statements instead of risking it. We also suggest always testing your Liquid statements before setting them live to parents/etc. Liquid Examples In this section, you will find several examples of Liquid statements using different field types. You can copy and paste these examples into your own templates, forms, etc. - just be sure to update the canonical field names so they match what is on your Finalsite Enrollment site. Click to jump to examples for: Boolean (Yes/No) Fields Single Select Fields Booleanlist (Multi-Select) Fields Contact Role or Status -- Boolean (Yes/No) Fields For Boolean fields, you can evaluate on three values: true (yes) false (no) blank (nil) See some examples of Liquid statements written based on Boolean fields below. Displays the text 'International Student' only if the Boolean field value is Yes (true). {% if contact.international == 'true' %}International Student{% endif %} Displays the text 'No' if the Boolean field value is No (false) or Blank. Otherwise, displays the text 'Yes'. {% if contact.field_yn != 'true' %}No{% else %}Yes{% endif %} Displays the text 'YES' if the Boolean field value is Yes (true). Displays the text 'NO' if the Boolean field value is No (false). {% if contact.international =='true' %}YES{% endif %}{% if contact.international =='false' %}NO{% endif %} In this example, blank (nil) values are ignored and won't display anything. This is good when you want to be explicit about the Yes/No choice made and don\u2019t want to show No if the value has been left blank. Displays the text 'NO VALUE SELECTED' if the Boolean field doesn't have a value (i.e. is blank). Note: There are two ways you can write this one. {% if contact.international == '' %}NO VALUE SELECTED{% endif %} OR {% if contact.international == blank %}NO VALUE SELECTED{% endif %} Single Select Fields The main difference between Single Select fields and Boolean fields is that with the former, you have to explicitly declare the value. If your Single Select field has Yes and No for values, you have to use \u2018Yes\u2019 or \u2018No\u2019 rather than true/false. Generally, statements will look very similar to Boolean fields but there are some additional use cases because the list of values can be more varied. In these cases, making use of and/ or may prove useful. Make sure to write \"and\" and \"or\" in lowercase for proper functionality. Example of an OR statement with a Single Select field. {% if contact.state == 'VA' or contact.state == 'DC' %}In Service Area{% else %}Outside of Service Area{% endif %} In this example, the text 'In Service Area' will display if the contact's state is VA or DC. Otherwise, the text 'Outside of Service Area' will display. Combining two different field values to create an output. {% if contact.color_1_ss == 'Blue' and contact.color_2_ss == 'Yellow' %}GREEN{% endif %} In this example, the text 'GREEN' will display only if the first Single Select field value is set to 'Blue' and the second Single Select field value is set to 'Yellow'. If only one of those two field values applies to the contact, nothing will display. These types of statements are good when you want multiple criteria to be true for a contact, since it checks the values from two (or more) different fields and outputs something only if both (or all) field values are present. Make sure to write \"and\" and \"or\" in lowercase for proper functionality. Similar to above, but with an added if/else &amp; else statement. {% if contact.color_1_ss =='blue' and contact.color_2_ss =='yellow' %}Green {% elsif contact.color_1_ss =='red' and contact.color_2_ss =='yellow'%}Orange {% else %}Gray {% endif %} To break this statement apart, we have two fields (\"Color 1\" and \"Color 2\") for which we are checking the values. If the selected values are blue AND yellow, the displayed text is 'Green'. If the values are red AND yellow, the displayed text is 'Orange'. If neither combination is true, then the displayed text is 'Gray'. Here is an example of calculating whether a student is old enough to enroll in Kindergarten and displaying that on a contact record. If the contact isn\u2019t applying for the K grade, then this statement will not show anything. (Make sure to write \"and\" and \"or\" in lowercase for proper functionality.) {% if contact.grade =='K' and contact.entry_age_month =='60' %}Eligible for Kindergarten{% endif %} Booleanlist (Multi-Select) Fields Booleanlist (multi-select) fields are stored in a manner that requires the use of the contains argument rather than equals (==). {% if contact.color_ms contains 'blue' and contact.color_ms contains 'yellow' %}GREEN {% elsif contact.color_ms contains 'red' and contact.color_ms contains'yellow'%}Orange {% else %}ALL IS GRAY {% endif %} This statement is similar to the above example but using a single multiple select rather than two different single selects. When writing these, make sure to write \"and\" and \"or\" in lowercase for proper functionality. -- Showing different content based on contact role or status It is common to only want to show certain information based on the contact\u2019s role or status. To do this, you wrap all the fields that you want to contextually show inside an if statement. See examples below. Note: Role is considered a multi-select field, so you should use 'contains'; however, Status is considered a single-select field, so you should use '==' (equals) or '!=' (does not equal). Displays the text 'Inquiry Student' if the Role field contains the 'Inquiry' value. {% if contact.role contains 'inquiry' %}Inquiry Student{% endif %} Displays the text 'Your Enrollment is almost complete!' ONLY if the contact's Status is Enrollment in Progress. If the contact is in any other status, nothing will display. {% if contact.status == 'enrollment_in_progress' %}Your Enrollment is almost complete!{% endif %} Note that statuses are written all lowercase and with underscores instead of spaces when writing Liquid statements (e.g. status == 'enrollment_in_progress' rather than status == 'Enrollment in Progress' ). How-To: Use Liquid Filters Liquid filters can be used to further format a string. They are denoted by placing a pipe character (|) then the filter name within the brackets, after your string. Some common ones for use in Finalsite Enrollment are listed below: Filter Name Usage Example Token Example Output capitalize Makes the first character of a string capitalized. {{ 'parker moore' | capitalize}} Parker moore date: \"%b %e, %Y\" Outputs date in text format (see section below for additional date format options). Enrollment Date: {{contact.enrollment_date | date: \"%b %e %Y\"}} Enrollment Date: January 1, 2021 format_phone Formats a phone number with dashes. {{contact.phone_1_number | format_phone}} 555-555-5555 format_phone_with_area_code Formats a phone number to have parentheses around the area code. {{contact.phone_1_number | format_phone_with_area_code}} (555) 555-5555 downcase Makes each character in a string lowercase. {{ \"Parker Moore\" | downcase }} parker moore upcase Makes each character in a string uppercase {{ \"parker moore\" | upcase }} PARKER MOORE Note on Date Filter You can format date fields in several different ways using the date filter. In the above example (date: \"%b %e, %Y\"), we output the date field in a text format (i.e. January 1, 2021). Some other common format options include: {{ \"now\" | date: '%Y-%m-%d' }} Outputs current date as YYYY-MM-DD Example: 2021-07-14 {{ \"now\" | date: '%m/%d/%Y' }} Outputs current date as MM/DD/YYYY Example: 07/14/2021 {{ \"now\" | date: '%m/%d/%y' }} Outputs current date as MM/DD/YY Example: 07/14/21 For other format options, see this page . Please note: The above examples would output the current date in the format specified; however, to use this filter on custom date fields, you can replace \"now\" with contact.[Canonical Name of Field]. Troubleshooting Tips If you are formatting a Liquid statement (for example, bolding the text or changing the color of it, make sure the formatting is outside the Liquid statement brackets {}. In more complex statements, break down the components and test them independently to ensure the argument is returning the expected value. If you're still having trouble, contact Support and include details about the Liquid statement you're using and an example you're using to test.

    "body": "Overview Images and video are a great tool for branding your communications and Parent Portal experience. They can also help engage applying or enrolling families with your school. In this article, you will learn about which templates within Finalsite Enrollment support images and/or videos, as well as how to add this content using the template editor . How-To: Add Images to Templates Images can be added to emails, letters, and parent portal content pages. They are not currently supported on labels or text messages. To get started, locate the template you want to add an image to and then click on the 'Edit' button next to it. There are two ways you can add an image within the template editor : 1. Add an image to a template directly by clicking on the Insert Image button (picture frame icon). You can then choose to upload an image file, enter a URL to an image file, or choose an existing image file that you previously uploaded to Finalsite Enrollment. 2. Drag and drop an image into the body of the template. This will automatically add the image to your image library and file manager so that you can use it again for future communications. Once you have inserted the image into your template, you can customize it further. Click on your inserted image to see the additional options. Alignment: Click on Aligns the image left, center, or right Delete: Click here to remove the image from your template. You can also select the image then hit the delete/backspace key to remove it. Insert Link: Click here to add a hyperlink to your image so that people are taken to a specific URL when the image is clicked. You also have the option to have the link open in a new tab when the image is clicked. Display: Click here to see your display options. You can choose to have the image display inline with your text, or you can break text and have the image embedded within the existing text. Style: Click here to change the style of your image. You can add a rounded or bordered style to your images. This is multi-select, so you can add both options if you like. To remove one or both of these effects, click it again in the list. Alternate Text: Click here to set alternate text to be used if the image file cannot be loaded and/or for screen readers. Resize Image: Click here to change the width and height of the image in pixel size. Read on below for more information on sizing your images. You are able to resize the image by dragging it from any of the corners. However, we recommend pre-sizing any images before uploading them in order to ensure consistency across all of your templates and in how the template is displayed for different users. See below for information on recommended image dimensions. * Recommended Image Size * We recommend pre-formatting your images to 600px (length) x 100px (height) before loading them into the template so that you will not need to make adjustments each time you select the image for a new template. This will guarantee consistency in your templates across users since the image will always be ready as-is. The max height we suggest is 150px. How-To: Add Videos to Templates Videos can be added to the following Parent Portal Content pages (within 'Settings - 'Portal' ) using an embed link: Inquiry Thank You Page Application Thank You Page Contract Thank You Page (if enabled within Communication Setup ) Contact Communication Area Contact Page Sidebar Portal Widget Summary Page Sidebar To enter your embed link, switch to 'Code View' (&lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; button) on the template editor and then paste the code. You will need to switch back out of code view before saving. For schools using Vidigami, click here to learn how you can add a custom picture slide-show to a student's checklist. * Video in Email * Please note: Most email clients do not support embedded video via the Javascript code they provide. It is also not recommended due to file size. Emails over 1 MB in size are often caught as spam. If you want to email out a video, it is recommended to share a link to a hosted location like Vimeo or Youtube instead. You can also upload files to the Finalsite Enrollment File Manager and share the link to it with families. You can also take a screenshot from your video and add a hyperlink to it, so that the parent/student receiving the email can click the image and be directed straight to the video.

    "body": "Overview Label templates are traditionally used for mailings; however, they can also be used to create name tags for any events you have or create folder labels for any hard-copy documents you are keeping for students. In this article, we will discuss how to create new label templates, manage your existing ones, and generate labels for students. How-To: Create &amp; Manage Label Templates You can access and manage your label templates by navigating to Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Label Templates on your site. On this page, you will see a list of all of your existing label templates with the following options: Create a new label template: Click on the ' Add a new Label Template ' button above your list of templates. Copy an existing label template: Click on the ' Copy' button to the right of the template you want to copy. This will open the template editor with a copy of the existing template. You can then make changes and input a name to save it as a new template. Edit or delete an existing label template: Click on the ' Edit' or ' Delete' button to the right of the template you want to edit or delete. Choosing to add, edit, or copy a label template will bring up the ' Edit Template' window. Within this window, you have access to the following options: Name: Set a name for or rename the template. This is the name that you will see in your list of label templates. They are organized alphabetically. Tag your template. Within the ' Tags ' field, you can create or select a tag to attach to the template. Tags are an internal-only way of organizing your communication templates. You can also add and remove tags in bulk within this page via the edit menu. You must select one or more templates before the ' Edit ' menu becomes available. You can read more about how to manage tags here . Type: Set the type of labels that you will be printing on after generation. Please refer to the chart at the bottom of this article for additional information on label types. Font size: Set the default size of the font for this label template. This can be adjusted on the fly when you generate your labels. Add text and data from the system: You can type directly into the text box or use the merge token picker to pull in dynamic data from the system. To learn about which types of merge tokens work in label templates, click here . Close: This will close the window without saving your changes. Save: This will save your changes. Be sure to click this button when you are done creating your template or making your desired edits! Unsaved templates or changes cannot be recovered. Please note: We do not currently support image placement in labels. If you need an image on your labels (e.g. a school logo), we recommend pre-printing the image on the label before generating the PDF of labels in Finalsite Enrollment. Filter Options and Edit Menu Filter Options Within the Label Templates page, you can use the Filter Options to search for by tags or filter the page by label template name. You can also filter by ' Blank' to see any custom template that doesn\u2019t yet have a tag. Using Filter by Name allows you to search for templates based on their name. Edit You can use the Edit Menu to add or delete tags in bulk. You must select one or more tags before the edit menu becomes available. Parent Name Tags Since label templates do not have the recipient category, they cannot be used to populate parent names in labels. However, if you want to build parent name tags, you can use any of the following options: Manually type in the following merge field to display Parent 1's name: {{contact.parent1.name}}. The same format can be followed for parents 2-4, and name subfields are available to you as well (e.g. first_name ). Use the Merge Field Picker or type in any of the contact.salutation merge fields, e.g. {{contact.salutation_first_and_last_names}}. Note: If no parent names are found, this will pull in the default salutation as configured under Basic Setup . Pull in the student's name with labels that say \"Parents of {{contact.first_name}} {{contact.last_name}}\". How-To: Generate Labels You can generate labels in bulk from a list page/search, or a student's contact record. If you are generating labels from a search or list page, you'll first need to select one or more students before the Communicate menu becomes available. Once you select your students, click on the Communicate menu and select Generate Labels. Then, pick your desired label template from the list of options. After choosing your label template, the Generate Labels window will appear, and you can set the options available for that template before generating a PDF to print. Read below for a description of all of these options. Addressee: Set the addressee to be either the contact (student), or their parents, or choose a predefined salutation. Please note: The addressee option will only display for mailing label templates. Font size: Set the font size for your labels. This will pull in the default font size set on the template, but you can click on the number to change it. Alignment: Set the alignment for your labels (i.e. left, center, right, or justified). Using Partially-Used Label Sheet: Set this to 'Yes' if you want to print to a partially used label sheet. Selecting 'Yes' will allow you to set the row and column on the sheet where you want your labels to start. Cancel: To cancel the label generation and exit out of the window. Generate Labels: When you click this button, the system will automatically download a PDF document of the labels to your computer. Printing Generated Labels Once you have successfully generated the labels and have the file downloaded onto your computer, follow these steps to print your labels: Open the downloaded file in a PDF viewer such as Preview (Apple computers) or Adobe (Windows computers) . Check the file to make sure the font size is appropriate for the data printed (e.g. long names wrapping to a new line, city/state/zip wrapping to a second line). Before printing, make sure you have selected the \u201cActual Size\u201d or \u201c100% scale\u201d option. Do not choose Scale to Fit, Fill Entire Page, or Fit. Print a test page. Some label templates are sensitive to which way is up when the page is inserted into the printer. Print the full file of labels. How-To: Reference Additional Parents or Households If you need to pull information for PARENT3, PARENT4, or HOUSEHOLD2 into a label template, you can do so using merge fields/tokens with the following formats: For PARENT3: {{contact.parent3. FieldName }} Example: {{contact.parent3.first_name}} to pull the first name of the student's PARENT3. For PARENT4: {{contact.parent4. FieldName }} Example: {{contact.parent4.phone_1_number}} to pull the number from the phone_1 field for the student's PARENT4. For HOUSEHOLD2: {{contact.household2. FieldName }} Example: {{contact.household2.address_address_1}} to pull the Address 1 line from the address field for the student's HOUSEHOLD2.

    "body": "Overview The contact record is the place to go for detailed information about each contact in your system. This article will detail what information you can find and what actions you can take on the contact record. Within the contact record, you will see the contact\u2019s student photo, current status, and the grade and term they are applying or enrolling for at the top left of the record. You can find the primary parent\u2019s contact information in the upper right of the record. To further customize the contact record, you can choose what fields you would like to display on the Summary tab by editing the Contact Widget (highlighted below) - click here to learn how! -- How-To: Understand Contact Record Tabs Within the contact record, you will see up to seven tabs. The tabs that display are based upon the modules you have with Finalsite Enrollment. Please note: For schools using the Review Module, the Review tab will only populate for a student once they are placed in the 'Review in Progress' status with at least one reader assigned. Each contact record tab will be summarized below. Click on any of the titles below to go to a dedicated help article for that contact record tab. Summary Tab On the Summary tab, you can track the contact\u2019s progress through their checklist, as well as create a reminder, note, or activity to keep track of tasks and conversations. This is also where you can view sent emails, related contacts, and submitted or uploaded forms/documents for the contact.

    "body": "Overview Within the History Page on the contact record , you can view a history of all of the statuses, activities, notes, and emails relating to the contact. Read on below for more information. Click here to return to the Contact Record Overview. How-To: Use the History Page When you are viewing a contact record, you can access the History Page by clicking the clock icon along the right side of the contact navigation bar. If you hover over it, you'll see the ' History ' label. Alternatively, you can access this page by clicking on the 'See full activity history' link within the Recent Activity section of the contact record. Within this page, you can show or hide the history of all items, statuses, activities, notes, and emails by selecting/deselecting the displayed icons with a click. From left to right, the icons you can choose are: All: This is selected by default and will show ALL categories (status history, activities, emails, and notes). Statuses (orange person icon): Will show status history. Activities (dark blue share icon): Will show activities, both standard and custom. Emails (green letter icon): Will show emails. Notes (light blue note icon): Will show notes. Below you will find a detailed explanation of each of these items. Status History This shows the entire status history of the contact, including any statuses that were passed, or if the student was moved out of the workflow. A note on passed statuses: If you see an option for 'See all statuses passed' to the right of the status change, this means that a student was moved directly from one status to a later stage status, but they 'passed' multiple other statuses in between the two. Example 1: If a student never inquires but goes straight to submitting an application, we consider them as having passed the Inquiry status. This is in order to keep the admissions funnel full from top to bottom. This contact will count in your cumulative inquiry number within the admissions funnel of your dashboard and in the funnel counts of your admissions report , but we can see from the record that they went straight to the applicant status because they started from \"not in workflow\" (meaning not yet in your admissions funnel). Example 2: If a student moved from an Applicant status to an Enrollment in Progress status, we would count them as having passed through the Application Complete status and the Accepted status. On the history page, statuses that were passed over will display in plain text, whereas statuses that happened automatically or manually by an admin account will be in bold. You can also see which admin account made a manual status change and the date it took place. This is a great way to troubleshoot why a student is in the wrong status. A team member may have moved the student to a different status, and you can then follow-up with them to discuss. -- Activity History Activities are added in the summary tab of the student record under ' Recent Activity '. If a note was added to the activity, this information will also display as we can see below. When an activity is first created in Recent Activity, you can set the viewing permissions based on user types in the system. The name of the user that created the activity will display to the right of it, along with a date. Please note: Some activities are automatically generated by the system such as online inquiry, online application, and application fee, and won\u2019t have a user or admin name assigned. Activities can be deleted by clicking on the red trashcan icon to the right of the activity. -- Email History All Emails that were sent to the contact or associated contacts (e.g. parents, consultants, etc.) within Finalsite Enrollment can be viewed here. Click on ' Email Details ' to expand and see the full email that was sent. The sender of the email and the date of the email will display to the right of the email. -- Note History Notes are added in the summary tab of the student record under ' Recent Activity '. If no activity type was assigned to the note, then it will have a tag of ' Note' . However, if an activity type was assigned to the note, then it is considered an ' Activity' instead (see above section on activities ). When a note is first created in Recent Activity, you can set the viewing permissions based on user types in the system. The name of the user that created the note will display to the right of it, along with a date. Notes can be deleted by clicking on the red trashcan icon to the right of the note.

    "body": "Overview Within the Manage Contract Menu on the contact record , you can take various actions relating to the student's contract. These include generating , regenerating , previewing , and deleting the contract. You can also preview the tuition and fees that will appear on the contract. Please note: The Manage Contract Menu is only available for schools using the Enrollment Module, and will only appear for students in enrollment. Click here to return to the Contact Record Overview. How-To: Use the Manage Contract Menu When you are viewing a specific contact record (for a student in enrollment) within Finalsite Enrollment, you can access the contract management options by clicking on the green Manage Contract button in the upper right of the page. Previewing the Contract Before or after generating the contract, you can use the 'Preview Contract' option to click through a full preview version of the student's contract, as the parent/guardian will see it in the Parent Portal. This is helpful to do before contract generation so that you can double-check that all tuition and fee amounts are applying as expected. Click here to learn more about Previewing Contracts! Generating or Regenerating the Contract If a contract has not yet been generated for the student, you will see the option for 'Generate Contract '. However, if you already generated the contract, this option will automatically change to 'Regenerate Contract'. With either option, once you have clicked it, a Contract Generation window will pop up with some additional information, and you will need to type in the word \"generate\" or \"regenerate\" to confirm the action. Contracts can also be generated in bulk . Click here to learn more about Generating and Regenerating Contracts! -- Previewing Tuition &amp; Fees After generating a contract, the 'Preview Tuition &amp; Fees' option will appear within the Generate Contract menu. When you click this option, a window will pop up displaying a summary of the student's tuition, discounts, and fees. You can also check any applicable optional fees or payment plans to see how those selections will calculate into the total. Deleting the Contract If you want to completely delete a student's submitted, in-progress, or generated contract and have the parent/guardian start over, use the 'Delete Contract' button at the bottom of the Manage Contract menu. You will be asked to confirm the action. Please note: This action permanently deletes the current contract and cannot be reversed! -- Other Enrollment-Related Actions The following options are not found in the Manage Contract menu, but they are additional enrollment-related actions that you may want to take on the contact record : Manage Tuition &amp; Deposit Overrides: Tuition Override and Deposit Override are term-based fields that can be used to override a student's assessed tuition or deposit amount. For example, if you have a student joining you halfway through the year, you may want to enter a prorated tuition amount for them using the override field. By default, these fields can be found within the Enrollment tab of the contact record. Use the 'Edit Fields' button and enter the amount you want the tuition/deposit to be ( not the amount you want to discount it by) into the override field, then save. You can also update these fields in bulk . Change a Student's Enrollment Type: Enrollment Type is a special field that indicates whether a student is new to enrolling at your school or returning for another year. It is often used in contract fee rules (e.g. if returning students get a different registration fee than new students do) as well as in search and reports. To change a student's enrollment type, click on the Edit menu in the upper right of the contact record, then select 'Change Enrollment Type for [Term]' and pick the desired option from the list. You will be asked to confirm the change. You can change a student's Enrollment Type for the current term or previous terms. Click here to learn more.

    "body": "Overview Within the Edit Menu on the contact record , you can view or change a student's grade, status , or enrollment type (if applicable) for the current or previous terms. You can also move or copy a student, change the contact's role(s) , or delete the contact from the system. Click here to return to the Contact Record Overview. How-To: Use the Edit Menu When you are viewing a specific contact record within Finalsite Enrollment, you can access the edit options by clicking on the green Edit button in the upper right of the page. ( Please note: Your available edit options may differ from what is displayed above, based on the modules you are using and the type of contact you are viewing). Here you will have access to the following options (click to jump to that section): Change Status Remove from Term Change Grade Previous Terms Change Current Term (Move/Copy) Add to Workflow Change Role Manage Readers Delete Record -- To change a student's status for the current term, click 'Edit' - 'Change Status for [Current Term]' , then select the desired status from the list. This option will always show at the top of the Edit menu options list. The status the student is currently in for the term will be indicated by a checkmark to the left of the status name. To change a student's status for a previous term, use the 'Previous Terms' option within the Edit Menu. See the section below on Changing Previous Terms for more information. -- You can also remove students from the current term or a previous term by using the 'Change Status' option within the 'Edit' menu. This option will always be at the bottom, underneath all of the statuses you can choose from. You will be asked to confirm that you want to remove the student from the selected term by clicking the red 'Remove' button. When a student is removed from a term, it will delete all history and activities for the student in that particular term only. All other data for all remaining terms will remain unchanged. However, if a student is only in one term, it will remove the student from the workflow. This cannot be reversed. -- Change Grade To change a student's grade for the current term, click 'Edit' - 'Change Grade for [Current Term]' , then select the desired grade from the list. This option will always show second within the Edit menu options list. The grade the student is currently in for the term will be indicated by a checkmark to the left of the grade name. To change a student's grade for a previous term, use the 'Previous Terms' option within the Edit Menu. See the section below on Changing Previous Terms for more information. -- Previous Terms In addition to viewing and changing current statuses, grades, or enrollment type, you can also clean up this data for any past terms within the Edit Menu. Simply select 'Previous Terms' from the list of options, select the term in which you'd like to change information, and update your selection as needed for that term. You will always be asked to confirm any change by clicking the blue 'Save' button. If you do not see the 'Previous Terms' option in the Edit Menu, this means the student does not have a history in any previous terms, only the current term. -- Change Current Term (Move/Copy) If you need to move or copy a student to a new term, you can do so using the 'Change Current Term' option within the Edit Menu. Please note: If you need to roll over students in enrollment to the next term, you should perform the Rollover action within the Enrollment List Page - Enrolled Students. The two actions you can take within the Change Current Term window are Copy and Move . Copy is used when you want to maintain the student's data in the current term, but also add them to an additional term. Move is used when a student is in the current term by mistake, so you want to remove their data from the current term and move it over to a different term altogether. Important Note: When moving or copying a record between terms, we will copy data in ALL term-based fields (standard and custom) into the new term (whether moving forward or backward). For a full overview of copying and moving students, click here . -- Add to Workflow The 'Add to Workflow' option within the Edit Menu can be used to add the contact you're currently viewing into workflow. It will only display for contacts who are not currently in the admissions or enrollment workflow (e.g. prospects and consultants). This option is commonly used to add Prospects to the workflow as an inquiry or other status. If you select this option, a window will appear where you can select the desired term, grade, and status for the contact. Click the blue 'Add' button to confirm and the contact will immediately be added to that workflow. -- Change Role The 'Change Role' option within the Edit Menu will display for not only students, but also for other types of contacts as well. This is where you can update the role(s) assigned to the contact -- such as legacy , former student, alumni, parent, or consultant . Click here to learn more about roles. -- Manage Readers For schools using the Online Review Module , the 'Manage Readers' option within the Edit Menu will only show for students who are in the applicant or application complete stage. When you click the Manage Readers button, a window will appear where you can assign or remove readers for the student. In the 'Readers' drop-down menu, you can select the readers you want to assign or remove for the student, then click the blue 'Save' button to confirm. Click here for more information. -- Delete Record The final option on the list within the Edit Menu is 'Delete Record'. This can be used to delete the contact record you are currently viewing, You will be asked to confirm this action. *IMPORTANT NOTE: Deleting a contact is PERMANENT . This action cannot be reversed by Finalsite Enrollment. If the record is a duplicate, consider merging instead of deleting to preserve all data.* Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Contact Record Overview Roles &amp; Statuses Explained Copying/Moving vs. Student Rollover",

    "body": "Overview The Parent Portal is the main point of interaction between your school and families during their admissions and/or enrollment process. For this reason, we have compiled some best practices for organizing and configuring your Parent Portal, to make it the smoothest experience possible for both your school and your applying or enrolling families. Parent Portal Checklist Best Practices In this section are some best practices for how to configure the student checklist so that it is easy for families to follow in the Parent Portal. To learn how to manage your checklists and implement the best practices below, please review the checklist management articles in our help center. Best Practice #1 - Use detailed Parent Explanations on the checklist Make sure each checklist item has detailed instructions for what the parent/student needs to do to complete the item, by adding a parent explanation in the checklist item setup. Some checklist items can be completed by the family, such as submitting online forms or uploading documents, while others may require your internal team to manually mark them as complete. Either way, you should always include instructions in the parent explanation stating what action needs to be taken and by whom for an item to be marked off as complete. For items that require documents to be mailed in such as a medical immunization form or an application fee check, the best practice is to include an explanation that states that your school will mark the checklist item as complete once you receive the completed form or check. Best Practice #2 - Create Online Forms for any previously paper-based forms Online Forms are a great way to collect information from your applying or enrolling families - no paper needed! The information from these forms (with the exception of teacher recommendations and document request forms) flows into the student and parent contact records so you can later search and report on the data too. You can create your own online forms based on existing paper forms you have, or our Support Team can assist you with getting them built out. These forms can then be linked to checklist items so they can be completed in the parent portal (or admin portal for internal-only forms). The associated checklist item will be marked off as complete once the parent or admin/user completes the form online. Please note: There may be some forms that we are unable to replicate online due to the nature of the form, such as a state form that needs to be on state paper, a medical form that requires a physician\u2019s signature, or a transcript release form which requires a handwritten signature. In these instances, you can use a File Upload or Multiple File Upload checklist item to allow parents to upload a scanned copy of the form to the checklist. Best Practice #3 - Link your Event Calendars to checklist items Calendar event/appointment booking functionality is supported within the Admissions and Enrollment Checklists. If enabled within the calendar settings , parents can book their own appointments through the checklist in the Parent Portal. In addition, you have the option to allow them to reschedule/cancel any booked appointments. When a student is booked for an appointment, the parent or other contact for the appointment will receive a confirmation and reminder email, as long as these are enabled in the calendar settings. Click here for more information. You can also book a student for an event/appointment in the admin portal (from the student's contact record ), and the family will be able to see the date and time they are scheduled for on the checklist item in the Parent Portal. Best Practice #4 - Utilize Required, Optional, and Internal checklist items Use a combination of required, optional, and internal items to streamline your admissions/enrollment process. Required Required checklist items are all of the items that must be completed for a student to be considered Inquiry Complete, Application Complete, or Enrolled. The checklist progress bar on the associated student list page will fill up in green as required items are marked complete. Required checklist items are visible to the parent/student and your internal team. Optional Optional checklist items are all of the items that do not need to be marked complete for a student to move into Inquiry Complete, Application Complete, or Enrolled statuses. These items do not affect the green progress bar as they are marked complete. Optional checklist items are visible to the parent/student and your internal team. Some examples of optional items are: Attend Open House Attend a Student Visit Day Upload a Student Photo Within the Parent Portal, any Optional checklist items will display at the bottom of the checklist, below all of the Required checklist items, in a section titled 'Optional Steps'. Internal Internal checklist items are hidden from the parent/student completely and are only visible to your internal team from a student's contact record . These items do not affect the green progress bar as they are marked complete. Some examples of internal items are: Transcript Reviewed/Approved Acceptance Letter Sent Interview Notes (this can be an internal-facing online form for your team to fill out after interviewing a family) Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Parent Portal Overview Parent Portal: Parent Experience How to Test the Parent Portal Experience",

    "body": "Overview The Parent Portal is the starting point for a parent to fill out an application for their student. It is also where parents can complete the required items for the Admissions or Enrollment process. In this article Access to the Portal Logging into the Portal Beginning the Admissions Process Navigating the Student Checklist Completing the Enrollment Process Access to the Portal Parents can access the Parent Portal login page by going to your unique school portal link. The format for this link is shown below: Non-Canadian Clients: Link Format: https:// [Subdomain Here] .fsenrollment.com/portal Example: https:// myschool .fsenrollment.com/portal Canadian Clients: Link Format: https:// [Subdomain Here] .fsenrollment.ca/portal Example: https:// mycanadianschool .fsenrollment.ca/portal Something Good to Know You can also use the merge token {{school.parent_portal_url}} in your Finalsite Enrollment Emails in order to auto-populate this link. Click here for more information. Logging into the Portal Did you know? Logins are the same across all Finalsite Enrollment Parent Portals. That means, if a parent has created an account before on another school's portal, they do not need to create another account, rather, they can log in with the same email/password or SSO in without creating a new account. First-time visitors will either: Manually create an account by selecting the Create an Account button and entering their username and password. To create a new parent portal account, all that is required is the parent's first and last name, a login email, and a password (minimum 8 characters and cannot include your subdomain). Manually created accounts will require parents to verify their email address within 24hrs. Create an account through SSO by selecting to sign in with Google or Microsoft. Returning visitors: Can sign in to an existing account with their email address and password or SSO in. Pro Tips: Check out our Overview of Parent Login Options: Manual Account Creation and SSO article for an in-depth overview of the parent login experience. Customize your school's Login Page Description template to welcome families to your Parent Portal and provide information on getting started, how to use the portal, and how to contact your school with any questions! How-To: Begin the Admissions Process in the Parent Portal The first time that parents log into the Parent Portal to apply, they will see the text that they haven't added any students yet, and a green 'Begin Admissions Process' button. When clicked, this button will take them to your Application Form. Click here to learn more about the parent view of the application form and any associated fee. If the parent already has other students in the admissions or enrollment process, they will see those students listed when they log into the portal. Below the list of students, they can click the green 'Add a new student' button to start an application for a new student. After the parent submits a new application, they will be taken to the Application Thank You Page, which is customizable from within 'Settings' - 'Portal' - 'Parent Portal Content' . They will also receive the Application Thank You Email if this option is enabled within your Communication Setup . Pro Tip: Customize your school's Portal Widget and Summary Page Sidebar templates to provide key information about the process, highlight the best parts of your school, list the contacts that parents can reach for help, and more. How-To: Navigate the Student Checklist in the Parent Portal Once a parent has added and authenticated to a student in the Parent Portal, they can access that student's checklist by clicking the blue 'Continue Admissions/Enrollment Process' (seen in the image above) button underneath their name in the list of students. From here, the parent can work their way through the checklist items. All required items will be in the top section, while any optional items will be separated below in an 'Optional Steps' section. Most item types will have a blue button for the parent to take some sort of action (e.g. complete an online form, upload a file, send a recommendation request, etc.), although you may also have some Basic checklist items that need to be manually marked complete by your internal team . We recommend including clear parent explanations for each checklist item so that the parent knows exactly what they need to do in order to complete it - click here for more information . Pro Tip: Customize your school's Contact Communication Area and Contact Page Sidebar templates to show specific information by student type. Our Support Team can help you set up liquid logic statements/rules so that you can set up different content based on the stage the student is in, such as admissions vs. enrollment. How-To: Complete the Enrollment Process in the Parent Portal * Getting Started * Once you have generated a student's contract and enabled parent enrollment , the parent can log into the Parent Portal and begin the process of enrolling in your school. They will access the checklist by clicking on the blue 'Continue Enrollment Process' button as described in the section above . A best practice is to have the Contract and Deposit checklist items at the top of the checklist. Click here to learn how to edit checklist settings. To open the contract, the parent will click on the blue 'Complete Form' button. Once a parent has opened the contract, the contract status will change from Generated to In Progress - click here for more information. Please note: A parent/guardian must be authenticated and have financial responsibility set to 'Yes' on the student contact record in order to open the contract. Students cannot have financial responsibility for themselves and therefore, will not be able to view the contract if they are authenticated instead of a parent/guardian. * Filling Out the Contract * The specifics of your Contract Form will depend on your school. However, most will have the tuition and fees, payment plans, and totals summary fields on them so that parents can see exactly how much they will be responsible for now and later. Any fields on the contract that were filled out previously (e.g. during the admissions process) will auto-populate the information as it exists on the student or parent records. Parents can select \u201c Save and Finish Later \u201d at any point while filling out the contract. If you are using the Dual Signature feature on your contract, the first parent will complete the contract, then be prompted to invite the additional signer. Both parties must sign the contract before the deposit can be paid. Click here to learn more about the dual signature workflow. * Paying Deposit * The final page of your contract is the payment page where the parent can pay the amount due now (i.e. contract deposit + any fees added to the deposit). The parent will select their method of payment, fill out any necessary fields and click the corresponding payment button to submit the contract and deposit. If the parent saves on this page, the contract status will change to Pending Payment. The Deposit checklist item will be marked complete automatically if the parent pays by credit card or electronic check. If they have elected to pay by check or a custom payment method, you will need to manually mark the checklist item as complete from the student's contact record upon receipt of the payment. * Post-Submit Behavior * At this point, the contract moves into a status of Submitted and the parent can no longer go back into the Contract to make changes (unless you regenerate the contract for the student). The parent can click on 'View Form' next to the completed contract checklist item to view or download a PDF copy of the submitted contract. After the parent submits the contract, they can be taken to the Contract Thank You Page, which is customizable from within 'Settings' - 'Portal' - 'Parent Portal Content' . They can also receive the Contract Thank You Email . These options can be enabled or disabled within your Communication Setup . A best practice is to direct them back to the Enrollment Checklist to complete any additional items. Please note: Even if enabled, Contract Thank You Emails are only sent automatically if the contract submission is performed by the parent. Bulk contract submissions by an admin or contracts subjected to countersign will not trigger the system Contract Thank You Email. If you are using the countersign or bulk submission feature and would like to learn how to set up an automatic communication plan to trigger a Thank You email post-contract completion, please refer to this article within the How-To Set Up an Automatic Contract Thank You Email section.

    "body": "Overview An authentication code is a unique system-generated code that's used to tie a child's checklist to a parent portal account. This allows parents/guardians to view and process their children(s) admissions and/or enrollment checklist(s). How it works When a parent creates an account and submits an application, they are automatically authenticated to their child. Additional parents/guardians needing checklist access or returning families new to Finalsite Enrollment requires manual authentication (more on this below). Once a parent/guardian/consultant has been authenticated, they maintain access year over year and do not need to re-authenticate each year. Their log-in email and password will remain the same. In this article Important Note on Re-Using Authentication Codes Automatic Authentication via Application Form Submission Assisting Parents Manual Authentication (Send Authentication Code) Change Authentication Revoke Authentication Best Practices for Troubleshooting Issues with Authentication Common Issues and How to Support Them Library of Additional Resources Important Note on Re-using Authentication Codes Authentication codes cannot be re-used by another parent. Why not? This created cases where parents would flip-flop linking portal accounts and it would cause issues with traceability. What to do if this happens If the wrong person has been authenticated, you'll need to revoke their authentication via the Portal Access page in the Households tab of their child's record . Once it's revoked, you can send them a new authentication code. Automatic Authentication via Application Form Submission When a parent/guardian submits an application form through the parent portal, the applicant and the parent/guardian that submitted the form will be linked automatically once the application is imported into the system. The parent/guardian will have immediate access to the child's checklist once the form has been imported. *Note: If a family filled out the online Inquiry form in the system and then filled out the application form, you will need to confirm the duplicate matched contacts and import the form before the parent can see their child's admissions checklist. The parent will see a note in the portal that says their admissions checklist is being built. Click here to learn more about form imports. Assisting Parents Manual Authentication (Send Authentication Code) Manual authentication is when the school provides an authentication code or a hyperlink with an authentication code to a parent/guardian that needs access to their child's checklist. This applies to the following instances: Only one or no parent is authenticated. The original email address used to create the parent portal account is no longer in use. One parent is authenticated to a second parent\u2019s email address. During re-enrollment, parents/guardians/consultants will need to enter an authentication code for each child to access their contract/registration form and enrollment checklist. This information is sent out in an enrollment email by the school, however, the parent/consultant may misplace the email and need assistance. Newly enrolled families will maintain their authentication that was granted during the admissions process. How-To 1. From the Parent Portal Access Tab of the student's record, select Send Authentication Code. 2. In the pop-up, select Send Email. The parent/guardian will receive an email including a link that, when clicked, brings them to the parent portal. When they log in, they'll be authenticated to the student. Change Authentication If you need to change the authentication from one parent/guardian to another. You can follow these steps to do so. 1. From the Parent Portal Access tab of the student's record, select Manage Authentication on the parent you are changing the authentication from. 2. In the pop-up box, select Change Associated Contact and select the contact you are changing the authentication to. Select OK to confirm. Revoke Authentication Follow these steps should you need to revoke a parent's authenticity. 1. From the Parent Portal Access tab of the student's record, select Manage Authentication on the parent you are revoking authentication for. 2. Select the Revoke Authentication option and click OK to confirm. Important Note for schools using Finalsite Enrollment Billing Payment Method and Revoked Accounts If you revoke the authentication of a parent and then send them an authentication code to a new email address, their payment method will need to be re-added. For Example Susan Michaels is a parent who is authenticated and has a payment method saved. Her email is susan@test.com. You go in and revoke her authentication and then send her a new authentication code to susanmichaels@hello.com. When she authenticates and connects the code to that new email, her payment method, which was tied to her original account, will need to be re-added. Check out the Parent Billing Workflow article for more info on how parents can add or re-add payment methods. Best Practices for Troubleshooting Issues with Authentication Make sure all parents are using their own unique email address to create a parent portal account. This is especially important if your school is using dual signatures for contracts/registration forms, as each signature requires it's own unique parent portal account. Make sure the parent has a parent portal account and that they're using the right email address to log-in. Most of us have more than one email address and they may have tried logging in with one that wasn\u2019t originally setup. This can be located within the student record --households tab--parent portal access--linked account column. You can also view a master list of parent portal accounts. Click here to learn more. See if the parent is already authenticated or not, which can be found in the student record--households tab--parent portal access--code column. Once all of the above has been checked, if the parent still can\u2019t log-in with the email address that\u2019s listed on this page, reset their password by clicking on the link under the password reset column, or they can reset their own password from the log-in page of the parent portal. Common Issues and How to Support Them First, how to navigate to where you can manage parent authentication... Open the student record Navigate to the Households tab -- Parent Portal Access tab Within this page, you'll see the following columns: Contact (1): The name of the contact associated with the child, or the student themselves. Code (2): The unique authentication code for each contact. Linked Account (3): The name and email address used to create the Parent Portal account. Portal Access (4): This is hard-coded to 'yes' for the student, so they can always access their checklist. However, if they do not create an account in the parent portal, then they won't have access to their checklist. Actions (5): This includes sending an authentication code to a contact that isn't yet authenticated, or managing authentication for an existing contact. Password Reset (6): This will send an email to the parent portal email address with instructions to reset the password on the account. Only One or No Parent is Authenticated Find the parent that has not yet been authenticated by looking at the contact column and authentication code column . If the parent/guardian has already been authenticated, you'll see the message, 'already authenticated.' Make sure the parent/guardian is using the email address in the linked account column to log into their account. If the parent/guardian has not yet authenticated, the authentication code will display. You can provide the code to the parent over the phone or click on the 'send authentication code' email link under the actions menu. If the parent/guardian does not exist, the parent must be added and saved within the Household Details page \u2013 Other Related contacts. Click here to learn more. Send the Authentication Code to the additional parent\u2019s email address, which is listed under the parent portal account column. The authentication code link is located under the actions column. A window will appear asking you to confirm that an email be sent to the recipient and email address listed. Click send email to finalize. If there is no parent email address, and you see \u201cN/A\u201d under the parent portal account column, you can add the email address after clicking send authentication code. Then click on the email address to add or edit the address and click the check mark to save your changes. If you need to reset the parent\u2019s password, click on reset password within the password reset column. A confirmation message will appear. Make sure the parent knows what email address to check for the email and to use as their log-in and then click ok. Original Email Address Is No Longer In Use Confirm with the parent that the authenticated email address listed under the linked account column is not the email address currently used. Under the actions column, click manage authentication. A separate window will appear with two options: Revoke Authentication: This option will remove the association between the parent and the current record, as well as any other contacts they\u2019re tied to. You will see this information listed after selecting this option. The parent will then need to create a new account within the portal using this email address. Change Associated Contact: This option will remove the association with the current parent and will re-associate access to the current record and any other contacts they\u2019re tied to with the parent/guardian you select from the drop down menu. Click OK to save your changes. IMPORTANT: If you updated the parent portal email address for the primary parent, and they would like this email address to be the one you have on file for them for all communications, you will need to update it. Click on the email address in the upper right and type in the new address. Click the checkmark to save the updated email address. View the parent portal access tab (1) again. Confirm that the new email address is not authenticated. N/A (2) will appear under the ' Linked Account ' column. Under the Action column, click send authentication code (3) . A dialogue window will display asking you to confirm that the authentication code email be sent to the recipient and email address listed. Click send email to finalize. One Parent is Authenticated to a Second Parent\u2019s Email Address Under the Linked Account column (1) , the email address associated with both parents should be the same. Under the 'Actions (2)' column, click ' Manage Authentication (3)' for the parent you would like to update. You'll see the following message if two parents are linked to the same email address. To resolve this, you'll need to revoke access for one of the contacts and click 'ok.' This parent/guardian will lose access to all contacts they're currently tied to. Once revoked, an N/A will appear beside that parent\u2019s name under the Parent Portal Account column. If you'd like to send an authentication code email to the contact, click on the ' send authentication code ' link under the ' actions' column. A dialogue box will display. If there's no email address listed for the contact, you can add it by clicking on ' add email .' Enter the new email address and hit the checkmark to set it. Then click ' send email.' The parent/guardian will then click on the authentication code link provided in the email you sent. They'll create a new parent portal account with their own unique email address and confirm their identity to authenticate. Once authenticated, the correct emails for each parent/guardian will appear in the Parent Portal Access page. Checklist access will also be granted to the parent/guardian.

    "body": "Overview If a parent forgets the password for their Parent Portal Account , there are three ways they can receive a password reset email. Read on below for instructions on each one of these ways: Option 1: Parent Reset from Parent Portal Login Page Option 2: Admin Reset from Student Contact Record Option 3: Admin Reset from the Parent Portal Accounts Page IMPORTANT: This article does not apply to the Single Sign-On option. SSO accounts are connected to a person's email server. If password reset help is needed with SSO, the parent/guardian should be directed to work within their Google or Microsoft account where they will have specific reset options for their email account. Read more in our Overview of Parent Login Options: Manual Account Creation and SSO article. Option 1: Parent Reset from Parent Portal Login Page From the Parent Portal login page, the parent can click on the blue 'Forgot your password?' link below where they would normally sign in to the portal. When this link is clicked, the parent will be prompted to enter the email address they used to create their account. Once they do so and click the Send Instructions button, they will receive the Reset User Password email, including instructions on resetting their password. IMPORTANT: The password reset link is only good for 2 hours until it expires. The parent will need to click on the link again after the 2 hours have passed. If the parent enters a different email address than what they used to create their account, they will be sent the Unknown Account email template, which lets them know there's no account associated with that email address. Smart Thinkin' A best practice is to brand these emails and update them with contact information. Both the Reset Admin Password and the Unknown Account emails are located within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Authentication Emails . If the parent is not sure what email address they used for their account, you can help them out. Navigate to the student's contact record, within the 'Parent Portal Access' page . The email listed there is the Parent's Portal email. The email they used to create their account can also be found on the Parent Portal Accounts page . Pro-Tip: This method also works for admins needing to reset the password for their Admin Portal Account. Simply navigate to the Admin login page (Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Admin Portal Accounts) , instead of the Parent login page, and follow the same steps above. Option 2: Admin Reset from Student Contact Record If you want to send a parent a password reset email from your side, you can do so from the associated student's contact record within Households &gt; Parent Portal Access . Locate the parent in the list of associated accounts, then click on the 'Reset Password' link in the Send Password Reset column. Once you have clicked the reset password link, you will be asked to confirm that you want to send this parent/email address a reset password email. You can then click 'OK' to proceed with sending the email, or 'Cancel' to go back. Make sure the parent knows which email account to check for the password reset email and to log in with on the Parent Portal. Pro Tip: You can also see what email address the parent used to create their account under the Linked Account column on this page. Option 3: Admin Reset from the Parent Portal Accounts Page You can also send a parent a password reset email as an admin by navigating to the Parent Portal Accounts page (Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Accounts) On this page, you can click on the Filter Options link to search by name or email (by typing them into the box provided), then click the blue Apply Filter button to submit. Once you have located the parent/email in the list, click on the Reset Password link to the right of their name. Note: You can also use the Edit button on this page to update the parent's portal email address if they mistyped it. Once you have clicked the reset password link, you will be asked to confirm that you want to send this parent/email address a reset password email. You can then click 'OK' to proceed with sending the email, or 'Cancel' to go back. Make sure the parent knows which email account to check for the password reset email and to log in with on the Parent Portal.

    "body": "Overview The Admissions Funnel and Current Counts are great ways to view, at a glance, your total numbers, yield, and current counts for each stage of the admissions and enrollment process. These can both be found on the Dashboard, which is typically the first page you see when you log into the Admin Portal. You can also access the Dashboard by clicking on the dial icon in the upper left of your Finalsite Enrollment site. How-To: Use the Admissions Funnel The Admissions Funnel , located within the Dashboard, is where you can quickly and easily view your key admissions metrics, according to the Term selected from the drop-down menu at the top of the page. It automatically tracks the real-time cumulative totals of your: Inquiries Applicants Application Complete students Accepted students Enrollment in Progress students Enrolled students You can click on any of these cumulative numbers in the center of the funnel to open a list of contacts in Search &amp; Reports. Please note: The cumulative numbers include any contacts that have been in a particular status at any point in time . For example, your number of Applicants in the funnel will include anyone currently in an Applicant status for the selected term, as well as anyone previously in an Applicant status in the current term, who has since moved on to other stages of the funnel. To the left of the Admissions Funnel and cumulative numbers, you can see important statistics calculated for you, known as the Yield Comparison . These percentage values are derived from the previous status. In the example above, we can see that 81% of our Inquiries became Applicants, and of those Applicants, 35% became Application Complete. All percentage values can be clicked on to populate the list of contacts included in that count within Search &amp; Reports. The percentage value in dark grey (12% in the example above) is your Yield , which is the number of Applicants that became Enrolled, as indicated by the dotted line connecting these two statuses with the yield percentage. How-To: Use the Current Counts Below the Admissions Funnel are your Current Counts of those progressing through each stage of the admissions and enrollment process. Current counts display how many contacts are currently in that particular status right now. This section will include both standard statuses, as well as any custom statuses you have created. You can click on any of the statuses or the numbers next to them to open a list in Search &amp; Reports of contacts who are currently in that status. This means that the contact list will not include anyone who was previously in that status but since moved on to a different status.

    "body": "Overview The Admissions Report (Search &amp; Reports &gt; Admissions Reports &gt; Admissions) allows you to track Admissions funnel data with student counts and yield rates. In this Article Admissions Report How are numbers compiled? How-To: Set the Default Reporting Term How-To: Understand Funnel Counts &amp; Funnel Rates Filter Options Admissions Report This Admissions Report allows you to compare cumulative counts, as well as conversion, selectivity, and yield rates, from your Admissions Funnel across years or as of a certain date. This report can be accessed within the Search &amp; Reports tab on your Finalsite Enrollment site. This report is useful for comparing the impact of your marketing or prospecting efforts. For example, if you had an Open House and you wanted to see what kind of impact that had on your admissions counts, you could type in the date of the Open House and see how your numbers changed before the event versus after. How are numbers compiled? To compile these cumulative counts, we make the assumption that each student has passed through all stages prior to their current stage. For example: If a student is moved from Inquiry directly to Accepted , we count them as having passed through the Applicant and Application Complete stages. If a student enters the system as an Applicant , we count them as having passed through the Inquiry stage. How-To: Set the Default Reporting Term The Admissions Report will show funnel counts and rates for the term set as your default reporting term, and the four years prior to that. If you want to change the default reporting term, navigate to Settings &gt; General &gt; Terms . Near the top of this page, you'll see the Default for Reporting drop-down menu, which you can set as desired. How-To: Understand Funnel Counts &amp; Funnel Rates Funnel Counts The first table on the Admissions Report page contains your Funnel Counts. This shows the number of students who passed through each status/stage of your admissions funnel (i.e. Inquiry, Applicant, Application Complete, Accepted, Enrollment, and Enrolled). By default, the Admissions Report will show the cumulative totals for each apply year (term), so that you can compare your numbers for the current term with the previous four terms. If you want to compare as of a specific date instead, you can use the \"Compare cumulative counts as of\" option at the top of the page. Funnel Rates The second table on the Admissions Report page contains your Funnel Rates . This shows your Yield Comparison for the current term and the previous four terms. Definitions: Conversion is the percentage of Inquiries that became Applicants. Selectivity is the percentage of Applicants that were Accepted. Yield is the percentage of Accepted Applicants that were Enrolled. Filter Options You can use your pre-configured filters on the Admissions Report in order to further filter down the funnel counts or rates by certain student criteria. For example, international vs. domestic students. Simply click the Filter Options button near the top of the page to choose your filters, then click on Apply Filter . If you need filter options added or removed, contact Support .

    "body": "Overview From the Search &amp; Reports menu, you can build custom searches, open saved searches, and view the data within the Admissions and Enrollment reports. Within Search &amp; Reports &gt; Search , you have a variety of options for building and editing a search or report. Filter by At the top of the Search page, you first have the option to select which term your search should be filtered by. When selecting a term filter, the results list displays contacts who have a status set for that term, otherwise known as \" in workflow \". Selecting different terms will update the data for fields that are stored year over year, such as status &amp; role. The \" Current Term \" option will return the data for the most recent \" in workflow \" term for the students. Menu Options Within a search, you have the following action items to choose from: Save : Save your search. Read more on this within this article . Export : Export your search. Read more on this within this article . Download : The download menu allows you to download contact photos and forms in bulk. Communicate : The communicate menu enables you to send emails, text messages, or generate letter or label templates. Edit : The edit menu allows you to add notes or activities to the students, change their status, update a checklist item or a field or remove the student(s) from the term. Types of Search Criteria You can pull up contacts using multiple different search criteria types: Admissions Status Enrollment Status Activity Checklist Item Calendar Event All other fields Please note that the Admissions Status, Enrollment Status, and checklist item fields are multi-select so you can select multiple options here. Search Statements Searches are built by combining one or more items under ' Edit search criteria '. To check your work, the written statement or natural language of your search terms will display below your search criteria (right above the blue Submit button) as you build out your search. This is a great way to check your search terms will populate the desired results, especially when combining 'AND' statements and 'OR' statements. See the section below for more information. And/Or Searches When building your search, be sure to select if you want 'AND' or 'OR' between search criteria to populate your desired results. While an 'AND' search combines multiple search criteria that you want to be true for the contacts (e.g. show me all students who are applicants AND have their transcripts submitted), an 'OR' search is like building a new search from scratch. This means that any criteria set above the 'OR' option will be its own search and anything below it will be a second search. We illustrate this by the white space created once you select 'OR'. Here is an example of using an 'OR' statement in search: I want to search for all of my students that have a current enrollment status of Enrollment in Progress AND a financial aid status of requested OR a scholarship status of requested. Let\u2019s break this down even further: Criteria 1: Enrollment status is currently enrollment in progress. AND Criteria 2: Financial aid status is requested. OR Criteria 3: Scholarship status is requested. We have three sets of criteria; however, the first two are tied together as one search because of the 'AND' in between them. The third criteria is now its own search and is looking for any contact with a scholarship status of requested, but no student type is specified. If you would like to see the scholarship status of only your students in the enrollment status Enrollment in Progress, you would need to add this criteria again after the 'OR', as displayed below.

    "body": "Overview Checklist items are applicable to the inquiry, admissions, and enrollment processes. Checklist item searches can be used to find students based on whether certain checklist items are complete or incomplete on their record. You can also search on checklist items by completion date . Checklist items can be seen on individual contact records (as shown below), and in the Parent Portal for your applicants and students in enrollment. Please note: It is not currently possible to search for a student's checklist item status/history in a previous term - only the current term that they exist in within Finalsite Enrollment. How-To: Run a Checklist Item Search To get started, click on the Search &amp; Reports tab at the top of your Finalsite Enrollment site. * Search for Checklist Items by Complete/Incomplete Status * Before adding your search criteria, you should select the Term to filter by from the drop-down menu. This will populate the checklist items specific to the year. To search for checklist items based on their completion status, try the following examples: 1. Find Applicants who did not complete their personal statement . You could then send a bulk reminder email to these families to go into the Parent Portal and complete the personal statement. You could also add columns with parent phone numbers to conduct follow-up by phone. -- 2. Find Applicants that completed their Application Form but did not complete their Application Fee. This type of search is useful if you allow families to pay the application fee by paper check. Since the Application Fee checklist item will not be automatically marked as complete for paper check payments, you can use this search to go through and see which families to follow up with about completing the payment. * Search for Checklist Items by Completion Date * Checklist items can also be searched for by their completion date.You can search by a set number of days, such as within the last 7 days or 30 days, or by a specific date range. 1. Find Applicants whose Campus Tour date is within the last 7 days. You could then send a bulk thank you email or letter to the attendees using the Communicate menu. -- 2. Find Enrollment in Progress (New &amp; Returning) contacts whose Contract was completed today. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Checklist Overview Search Overview",

    "body": "Overview Calendar Event searches can be used to find contacts who are registered for an upcoming appointment on a calendar, or who were registered for an event in the past. Please note that this search criteria does not track if someone actually attended an event - only that they were registered for it. You would need an attendance sheet at the event, and then manually mark the associated calendar checklist item as complete in bulk from the saved registration search/report. Attendance can then be searched by using the checklist item complete search criteria. In this article How to Create a Calendar Registration Search Duplicate Appointment Bookings Appointment &amp; Schedule Fields Example Search Scenarios How to Create a Calendar Registration Search To get started, click on the Search &amp; Reports tab at the top of your Finalsite Enrollment site. To search by a calendar event , you will set the following criteria: Search criteria type: \"Calendar Event\". Select a specific calendar from the list. Select \"is scheduled\" or \"is not scheduled\". Select the desired date or range to search from the list of options provided. Please note: \"Week\" date options are defined as Monday through Sunday. Duplicate Appointment Bookings If a parent has signed up for an appointment more than once , you will see both appointment slots listed in the event search under the date column. You can manage duplicate bookings from the student's checklist in their contact record. Appointment &amp; Schedule Fields After you've set your calendar search criteria, you may want to display appointment details and/or schedule information. Here's how to pull in additional information that was collected as part of the event sign up. Select Change/Display Columns in the upper right of your search results. Open the Calendar option under the Grouping section. Select a calendar. This populates fields with information related to that specific calendar. Select your desired fields and click apply to pull them into a search. Read below the example to learn about what kind of information each of the fields you see will pull in. Appointment Contact Fields: These are used for all event registrations through forms, public calendar links, and checklist item registration. Internal Note: This field only displays to Admins when booking a contact for an event through the Admin side of the checklist. Parents will not see any content entered in this field. Schedule Appointment Text: This is an optional field that's available for each schedule so that you can set customized text or messaging for each schedule. It's also available as a merge field that can be added to your event emails. Schedule Name: This field displays the name of the schedule. Schedule Video Conferencing Link: This is an optional field that's available for each schedule so that you can set a custom video conferencing link for each schedule. It's also available as a merge field that can be added to your event emails. {{calendar_name}} Date: This field displays the appointment day, month and date, and start/end time. Want to learn more about User Schedules? Read our article on Creating &amp; Using User Schedules . Example Search Scenarios 1. Find Applicants who have a parent interview scheduled this week.

    "body": "Overview The Enrollment Refresh Tracker is a tool to guide you through the necessary steps needed to prepare for student enrollment each year. The tracker is located within Settings &gt; General &gt; Enrollment Refresh Process in your Finalsite Enrollment site. IMPORTANT: Before you begin enrollment, please set up and activate your upcoming Enrollment term within Settings - Fields &amp; Data - Enrollment Setup . How-To: Use the Enrollment Refresh Tracker Getting Started On the Enrollment Refresh Process page (Settings &gt; General &gt; Enrollment Refresh Process), you can start by setting the dates that you\u2019d like to send your enrollment contracts out for your Returning and New Students within the ' Contract Dates ' section. These dates are for your reference only and do not affect anything else in the system. To store the contract dates, click on the Save button at the bottom of the page. To the right of the contract dates section is a link to sign up for additional training and office hours. You can also click here to learn more. Enrollment Refresh Items Next on the page is your Enrollment Refresh Checklist . This is a list of items that you need to review for the upcoming enrollment year to make sure all of your data is up to date. As you complete items on the list, mark the checkbox along the left side. Click on the review and update link for any of the items and you will be redirected to the referenced content on your Finalsite Enrollment site. If you need help understanding any of the pages or items, click on the help link on the right to access a help article about them. To save your progress on completed items, make sure you hit the blue Save button at the bottom of the page. The enrollment refresh items include: Setup New Enrollment School Year : Activate the new school year (term) within the Enrollment Setup page. Within that page, you will also have the option to: edit the parent-facing name of your Contract and/or Deposit enable contact photos on contracts enable the countersign feature enable the continuous enrollment feature Tuition and Fees : Review and update your tuition amounts, required and optional fees, payment plans, etc. You can also review what amounts you'd like to include to be paid with the deposit (i.e. which fees should be paid immediately at the time of contract signing). Payment Plans : Review and update your payment plans. Check that the plans you want to provide as options are set to active. Make sure the parent explanation text is up to date. Confirm that any fees you need to have attached to payment plans are set up and attached to the correct plan(s). Contract Form Language : Review and update any language/wording on the Contract Form. Enrollment Forms: Review and update any wording on your custom enrollment forms, for example, the intent to enroll form, field trip permission form, etc. Deposit Instructions (optional): Review and update the custom instructions that will appear on the deposit payment page for parents. Checklist Items and Descriptions : Review your required, optional, and internal-only checklist items and any show/hide rules associated with them. Also, review the parent-facing description text for any required and optional items. Downloadable Documents : Review any documents that are linked within checklist item descriptions, custom email templates, parent portal content pages, etc., and make sure they are current and up-to-date for the new school year. You can replace an existing file with a new version within Settings - General - File Management . Contract Thank You Email : Update the automatic thank you email that gets sent once contracts have been fully submitted. Please note : When enabled, Contract Thank You emails are only sent automatically if they are enabled within the Communication Setup Page (Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Setup) and if the contract submission is performed by the parent. Bulk contract submissions by an admin or contracts subjected to countersign will not trigger the system Contract Thank You Email. If you are using the countersign or bulk submission feature and would like to learn how to set up an automatic communication plan to trigger a Thank You email post-contract completion, please refer to this article within the How-To Set Up an Automatic Contract Thank You Email section. Enrollment-related Related Emails : Review and update all other emails sent during the enrollment process, such as emails sent when contracts are available, checklist completion reminders, etc. Term-Based Fields : Review any fields you have that are term-based and may need to be updated for the new enrollment year. Testing : Set up a test student or use an existing one to make sure everything is looking and working as expected. Some things to test include previewing all tuition and fees for different contract rules (such as grade level criteria, etc) via the contact record before contract generation. Next, you can test the parent view of the checklist using the impersonate action to confirm rule-based checklist items and parent explanation text are displaying properly. If anything isn't working as expected and you're not sure how to fix it, contact our Support Team so we can help! Enrollment Process Now that everything has been reviewed and updated, you can begin the Enrollment Process for your returning students and your new students. Follow the steps in order and mark the checkbox along the left as you complete each item. If you need help, click on the help link on the right to access a help article about the item. To save your progress on completed items, make sure you hit the Save button at the bottom of the page. Please note: Before you complete the enrollment process steps, you should create and activate the new enrollment year. Click here to learn how. Rollover Returning Students : Using the rollover action , you'll roll over all returning students except the ones marked as mid-year withdrawal. Students who are not returning for the following year will still need to be rolled over. After rolling them over, you will set their status to ' Not Enrolling ' (see next step below). Review Class Roster and Move Not Returning Students to the Appropriate Status : For any students who are not returning for the new year, you still need to roll them over so that they remain active for the prior year. Once they've been rolled over to the new year, you will then set them to an inactive status of ' Not Enrolling. ' Update any field values that may drive contract tuition, deposits, and fees : See the Contract Fees page to determine which fields drive your fees. You can update fields directly on the student record , in bulk with a search , or with an update import . You'll want to add/update values to any field that you need to either trigger a fee for a student or add an amount in them (ex. scholarship amounts). Reminder, term-based fields clear out with rollover and non-term-based fields do not clear out (they keep the same data year over year unless it's manually cleared out). Some examples of non-term-based fields include custom tuition assistance and scholarship fields, academic or athletic fees, transportation fees, etc. Term-based fields will be cleared for the new term so you can enter new values, as applicable. Verify contract amounts are correct for returning families: Before you generate contracts for your new or returning students, a best practice is to preview them to make sure that all contract fees (e.g. tuition, fees, and discounts), custom scholarships, payment plans, and other contract content is populating as expecting. Generate Contracts for returning families: Generate contracts in bulk for your returning families and review the tuition and fees. Send enrollment email to returning families: Send out the enrollment email to your returning families. This email should include clear instructions for creating/logging into an existing parent portal account, merge fields for authentication codes, and any additional instructions required for your school's process. If you have dual signatures on contracts. Make sure you inform families that they must create two different parent portal accounts with two different email addresses in order to sign. Click here for more information. Update status of accepted students to enrollment in progress: Once you move Accepted students over to Enrollment , the enrollment checklist will become visible to the family in the Parent Portal, as long as parent enrollment is enabled , but they will not have access to the contract until you generate it. Verify contract amounts are correct for new families: Same as above (' Verify contract amounts are correct for returning families' ) but for your new families. Generate contracts for new families : Generate contracts in bulk for your new families and review the tuition and fees. Send enrollment email to new families: Same as above (' Send enrollment email to returning families' ) but for your new families.

    "body": "Overview Throughout the enrollment process, it\u2019s important that you know how to create custom searches and reports so that you can access the data you\u2019re collecting from enrolling families. This article provides a variety of sample searches that you can use and tailor to your specific process. Please keep in mind that your fields may vary from the examples provided below, and you may have additional fields of data that you\u2019d like to include when building your search. All searches should be saved for repeated use , and may also be exported to Excel to format your data into other forms (e.g. calculations and visual reports). Use the links below to jump directly to a specific search example: Number of New &amp; Returning Students by Grade Completed Contract Completed Contract, Incomplete Deposit Completed Contract, Incomplete FACTS Contract Amounts Report Contract Status Summary Report Late Contracts Financial Aid &amp; Scholarship Report Enrolled Student List with Parent Names, Phone Numbers, Address How-To: Run a Custom Enrollment Search To get started with any of the search examples provided below, click on the Search &amp; Reports tab at the top of your Finalsite Enrollment site. Number of New and Returning Students by Grade To see a total count of your new and returning students by grade level for the current enrollment year or years prior, you can create a summary report. 1.

Add the following to your search criteria: 'Enrollment Status' - 'New &amp; Returning' - 'is currently' - 'Enrolled'. Then, click the blue Search button. 3. Once the search results have loaded, click on the blue Change Display/Columns button in the upper right of the page and select the Summary Report option. 4. Set Enrollment Type as the row heading and Grade as the column heading. If you want a total count of just one of these criteria, you can set it as the row heading and leave the column heading blank. 5. Click the blue Apply button to confirm and you will see your summary report! Completed Contract To look for all students in enrollment with a completed contract, you can run the following report. 1. Set the Term (school year) to filter from the drop-down menu at the top of the search page. 2. Add the following to your search criteria: 'Enrollment Status' - 'New &amp; Returning' - 'is currently' - 'Enrollment in Progress'. Then, click the blue Search button. 3. The contract is an enrollment checklist item, so add the following to your search criteria: 'Checklist item (by complete/incomplete') - 'Contract' (or registration form, depending on what your school calls it) - 'is complete'. Completed Contract, Incomplete Deposit Maintaining a list of families that have submitted the contract but have not yet paid their deposit makes it easy to send follow-up communications in bulk to remind parents/guardians that the deadline is approaching. 1.

Now you have a comprehensive report of the important contract information for your enrollment in-progress students! To customize this report further, you can go back into the Change Display/Columns window and select the List by Grouping option to sort by grade level, contract status, etc. Contract Status Summary Report To see an overview of where your students are in completing their contracts, you can create a summary report based on Contract Status. This will give you a total count of your students and who is pending their contract being generated, who is working on their contract, who needs to pay their deposit/registration fee, who needs a second signature for dual signature enabled contracts, and who submitted their contract. 1. Set the Term (school year) to filter from the drop-down menu at the top of the search page. 2.

You could also search for contract completion before or between specific date ranges. For example, if you want to see who qualifies for an early enrollment discount. Financial Aid &amp; Scholarship Report When managing financial aid and scholarships, you can display this information in a single report or you can create a report for each (e.g. one report for Merit Scholarship, one report for Athletic Scholarship, and so on). 1. Set the Term (school year) to filter from the drop-down menu at the top of the search page. 2. Search for the students you want to include in your report. For example, you might add the following to your search criteria: 'Enrollment Status' - 'New &amp; Returning' - 'is currently' - 'Enrollment in Progress' AND 'Enrolled'. Then, click the blue Search button. 3. Once the search results have loaded, click on the blue Change Display/Columns button in the upper right of the page. 4. Select any financial aid, scholarship, or other tuition-related fields that you need in your report. Aid-related fields are typically saved within the Tuition Assistance grouping. Open this group to see a list of fields related to Financial Aid. (You also have other groupings that you may find aid-related fields in, such as your Scholarship group. Scholarship and Tuition Assistance are the most common groups that financial aid fields are stored within.) 5. Click the blue Apply button to confirm and you will now have a report on financial aid and scholarship amounts! You can organize your data further by going back into the Change/Display Columns window and selecting List with Grouping . You can then group your results by grade level or by scholarship name , if appropriate. Enrolled Student List with Parent Names, Phone Numbers, Address A parent directory is a useful tool to have on hand for your enrolled students so you can contact families quickly and easily. If you have emergency contact information, you can include this as well, or create a separate report for it. 1. Set the Term (school year) to filter from the drop-down menu at the top of the search page. 2. Add the following to your search criteria: 'Enrollment Status' - 'New &amp; Returning' - 'is currently' - 'Enrolled'. Then, click the blue Search button. 3. Once the search results have loaded, click on the blue Change Display/Columns button in the upper right of the page. 4. To pull in the student's primary address, select Household 1 from the Entity dropdown. Under Grouping select Address and then under Fields select Address . 5. To pull in the names and phone numbers for the parents that reside in the primary household, start by updating the Entity dropdown to Parent 1 . Next, type \"name\" into the search box and select the name field that appears in the Fields section to pull it in as a column in the search. Then, search for \"phone\" and select one or more of the phone numbers that appear in the Fields section. Once you've done this, you'll have the name and phone number(s) of the primary parent in the student's primary household pulled in as columns in your search. Repeat the process by changing the Entity to Parent 2 and then search for \"name\" and \"phone\" number just like before to pull in that same information for the second parent. 7. If you'd like to, you can reorder the columns within the Selected Fields section by dragging them up or down within their individual sections. Then, click the blue Apply button to confirm and you will now have a parent directory report!

    "body": "Overview When a newly accepted student is moved to Enrollment in Progress, or when your existing students are rolled over and ready to enroll for the new school year, you will need to generate contracts individually or in bulk so that parents can access them within the Enrollment Checklist in the Parent Portal. Contracts in Finalsite Enrollment can exist in several different states, starting from Pending (i.e. not generated) and ending with Submitted (i.e. when the contract is signed and submitted with a paid deposit). In this article, you will learn about these different states and what your enrolling families can see in the Parent Portal for each one. How-To: Understand Different Contract States An enrollment contract in Finalsite Enrollment will always start as 'Pending' before it is generated, and can go through the following states: Please note: Contracts will not necessarily pass through each of the contract states listed above. This is dependent on specific features being enabled (e.g. dual signature, online deposits, and countersign) and your school's process. Each contract state is described in more detail below. Pending Description: This is the beginning state for any contract. This means that a contract has not yet been generated for the student and it is pending generation by you or your team. Parent Portal View: Parents can see the contract checklist item (as long as parent enrollment is enabled ); however, there is no 'Complete Form' button to view or access the form. Parents cannot complete the form at this stage. Generated Description: The contract has been generated for the student and is available on the Parent Portal to be reviewed and completed (as long as parent enrollment is enabled ). Parent Portal View: The contract checklist item will now have a blue 'Complete Form' button next to it. The parent can click this button to access the form and begin filling it out. Please note: If a contract has the status of Generated but appears with a warning symbol next to it in the Admin Portal, this means the contract was generated with errors and the parent will NOT be able to complete it in the Parent Portal. You must first resolve the errors, then regenerate the contract. In Progress Description: The contract form has been opened by the parent in the Parent Portal, but they have not yet reached the pending signature (if dual signature is enabled) or pending deposit payment stage. Parent Portal View: The parent may click on the 'Save &amp; Finish Later' button at the bottom of the contract while filling it out to save in progress. When they return to the Parent Portal, they can resume the contract by once again clicking the blue 'Complete Form' button. Pending Signature Description: This only applies if the dual signature feature is enabled. Once the first parent has signed the contract and invited the second parent to sign, the contract will show the status of Pending Signatures until the second signature is captured. The deposit payment page will not be available until both signatures are submitted. Parent Portal View: The second parent/signer cannot make any changes to the contract unless it is regenerated by the school. Neither parent can submit the deposit payment until both signatures have been submitted. Pending Payment Description: The contract has been completed up to the point of the deposit payment page, but the deposit payment has not yet been submitted. Parent Portal View: The parent cannot make any changes to the contract at this point. They need to pick their payment method and click submit for the contract to be considered complete. They will see a pay deposit button, which will bring them to the payment page. Pending Countersign Description: For schools with the countersign feature enabled only. This means the contract has been signed by all parents/guardians, the deposit may or may not have been paid yet, and it must be countersigned by a representative from your school before it can be considered complete. Countersignatures can be added to contracts either in the pending payment status or in the submitted status. IMPORTANT NOTE: If the deposit is paid before the countersignature is added, the deposit checklist item will not be checked off. The deposit will be checked off once the contract is fully submitted (and therefore countersigned). Parent Portal View: The Contract checklist item will display with the text 'Pending Countersign' underneath the parent explanation. Contract and Deposit checklist items will remain incomplete until the countersignature is added, at which point the contract moves to Submitted and the deposit checklist item marks as complete (unless the parent is paying by check/custom method later). Submitted Description: The last stage of the contract workflow. This means the contract has been completed, signed by all necessary parties, and the deposit has been paid (if applicable). Parent Portal View: The contract checklist item will be marked complete with a green checkmark. Parents can view and download a printable PDF of the contract by clicking on the 'View Form' button. They cannot make any changes at this point unless you regenerate the contract (which deletes the submitted one). How-To: Understand Regeneration Rules If you need to make changes to any contract fees or contract fee rules, keep in mind that different rules apply for regeneration based on the contract states. Some are dynamic and will automatically update with any changes, whereas some contract states require regeneration for changes to take place. Contract states of Pending, Generated, and In Progress are dynamic and will update with any fee or fee rule changes. There is no need to regenerate contracts in these states after making a change to fees, fee rules, or contract form content . Once the parent logs back into the Parent Portal and opens the contract, they will see a message highlighted in red at the top of the page, stating that changes have been made since they last visited the form and to make sure to review before proceeding. Contract states of Pending Signature, Pending Payment, or Submitted are not dynamic. You must regenerate contracts in these states after making a change to fees, fee rules, or contract form content. Regeneration deletes the previous contract. You can either opt to regenerate the contract with the parent's signature click here to learn how) or regenerate and submit the contract internally click here to learn how ). With either option, the parent will not be prompted to pay the deposit again. The first three contract states (i.e. pending, generated, in progress) don't have a submitted signature from the parent, which is why they are dynamic and will update without regeneration. However, the last three contract states (i.e. pending signature, pending payment, submitted) have a submitted signature from the parent, which means the terms are now legally binding. As a result, the contract must be regenerated for any fee, fee rule, or other contract changes to be applied.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment provides several tools to manage scholarships. Forms and checklist items can be used to allow parents and students to apply for scholarships while fields , custom filters , and searches are used to track and manage the status of the scholarships. For awarding scholarships and applying those amounts to the contract, there is a special field type called ScholarshipField that allows you to set up any number of scholarships and manage the awards. Read on below for details! About Scholarship Fields Scholarship Amount (scholarship_amount) is a standard field that is term-based , meaning it holds a unique value per term for a student. This can be used to input a total scholarship amount to automatically deduct from the tuition on a student's contract. Custom scholarship fields can also be added to your Finalsite Enrollment site so that you can track amounts for specific types of scholarships (e.g. Merit Scholarship, Athletic Scholarship, etc.). You can add new custom Scholarship fields on your end, but please feel free to Support Team for any assistance you need with this. Amounts entered into custom scholarship fields are also deducted from the tuition amount on a student's contact. We recommend setting Custom Scholarship fields as term-based so that you don't have to clear them out manually each year. Read more about this within our Term-Based Fields &amp; Enrollment Refresh article(see the Custom Term Based Fields section). Once the scholarship fields have been added, they will appear on the Fields Setup page. From this page, you can edit the display names of the Scholarships. The name will be displayed on the contact record and on the contract if the scholarship(s) are awarded. Additional Tips Use the Scholarship Status field to make it easy to search for students interested in the scholarship process or track their progress through the process. As you award scholarships, change the Scholarship Status, so that you can create a report that displays each scholarship type in a column to get a picture of who has been awarded a scholarship and how much they received. How-To: Award Scholarships To enter scholarship amounts for an individual student, you can follow these steps: Navigate to the student's contact record . Click on the Enrollment tab within the contact record. Click the blue Edit Fields button in the upper right. Find the scholarship field you wish to edit. Please note: You can put scholarship fields under any grouping, but they are most often found under Enrollment, Tuition &amp; Fees, or Tuition Assistance. If you cannot see the scholarship field you want to update, check your Contact Layout page to ensure it is set to display. Enter the amount into the scholarship field. Click on the green Save Edits button to confirm the change. The scholarship name and amount will now appear on the contract. You can preview the contract to see how it will look. If you have multiple scholarship amounts to award, consider entering the amounts through: Bulk Edit : Use the Update a Field option within the Edit menu on any list page or search/report. Import : Create a bulk update template for scholarship amounts that you can edit in Excel, then import it using our Import Data Tool .

    "body": "Overview This article explains how to enable or disable parent access to Admissions and Enrollment checklists and forms within your school's Parent Portal. Who can access this feature and where is this setting located? Where is this setting located? Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Content under the Enrollment and Admissions section. Admin Account Types: System Admin and Admin Permissions: Any In this article Accessing Settings Enrollment Settings Admissions Settings Important Considerations Accessing Settings Go to Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Content . Scroll down to the Enrollment and Admissions section. Here, you'll be able to control the access of the Admissions and Enrollment checklists as well as your Application. Enrollment Settings Parent Enrollment Enabled Enabled (Checked) Parents can access their enrollment checklist and any associated forms (e.g., contracts, registration forms). Disabled (Unchecked) Parents cannot access their enrollment checklist or forms. Even if you generate contracts, parents won't be able to view them until you re-enable this setting. However, parents will still see the \"Enrolling for 'X' Grade in 'Y' Term\" message next to any enrolling students, but they will not be able to access the enrollment checklist. Important Notes Communication: Parents are not automatically notified when this setting is turned on or off. If you are opening or closing enrollment, consider sending a notification to inform them of the change. Billing Access: Disabling enrollment access does not affect the Billing Management tab within the Parent Portal. This tab remains accessible to parents. The Billing Management tab cannot be disabled or turned off. Admissions Settings Parent Admissions Application Enabled Enabled (Checked) Families can submit application forms through the Parent Portal. Example of when a parent does not yet have a student attached. The green \"Begin Admissions Process\" button is showing. Example of when a parent already has a student attached. The links at the bottom are still there. Disabled (Unchecked) Families cannot submit applications. Read the notes below to learn how this affects new and existing users as well as different parts of the site. New Users without a student attached: Upon their first login, they will only see the Authentication Code button and not the option to submit an application. Existing Users with a student attached: The options to submit additional applications through the parent portal that appear under the authentication code link are not available. What's affected outside of the Parent Portal Finalsite Explore: The \"Apply Now\" button in Finalsite Explore will be hidden. Application Links: Any shared URLs to your application form will redirect to the Parent Portal with the message \"The application is not open at this time.\" Parent Admissions Workflow Enabled Enabled (Checked) Parents can access the Admissions checklist (application checklist). Best Practice: If you turned the Parent Admissions Application setting off so that no new families can apply, keep the admissions workflow enabled so families who previously submitted applications can still access and complete their checklists. Disabled (Unchecked) Parents cannot access their admissions checklist or forms. However, parents will still see the \"Applying for 'X' Grade in 'Y' Term\" message next to any enrolling students, along with a note that \"Admissions is not yet open for this year\". Saving Changes After making any changes to the Enrollment and Admissions Settings, click Save at the bottom of the page to apply them. Important Considerations Enrollment Checklist Visibility: Enabling the Parent Enrollment option immediately makes the enrollment checklist visible to parents of students with an active enrollment status . Before enabling this option for the year, review and update any relevant Parent Portal Content pages (web templates) related to enrollment. You can edit these templates directly on the Parent Portal Content page by clicking the Edit button next to each template.

On this page, all templates will be listed alphabetically by the Template Name (1). You can click the Edit (2) button to the right of any of the templates to view or make changes to them using the Template Editor . Descriptions of each template can be found in the section below titled \"How-To: Use Parent Portal Content Pages\". Template Descriptions In this section, you will find a description of each Parent Portal Content template and where it appears within the Parent Portal. Use the links below to jump to a specific template/description in the list. Inquiry/Application Templates: Application Fee Check Instructions Application Fee Instructions Application Thank You Inquiry Thank You Billing Templates: Autopay Terms &amp; Conditions Billing Management Widget Enrollment/Contract Templates Contract Thank You Deposit Check Instructions Deposit Instructions Dual Signature Instructions Portal Templates: Contact Communication Area Contact Page Sidebar and Contact Page Sidebar Header Login Page Description Portal Widget Summary Page Sidebar and Summary Page Sidebar Header Other: Custom Fee Check Instructions Custom Payment Instructions Pay Now Instructions Shared Portal Page (only available to those using the Shared Portal) Pro Tip: Merge fields can be used on certain Parent Portal Content pages for added personalization - click here for more information. -- Application Fee Check Instructions These are the instructions that display on the Application Fee payment page when the 'Check/Cheque' option is selected as the payment method (if enabled as an option in your Application Fee Setup ). A best practice is to provide instructions on where to mail the check and who to make the check out to. You may also want to include a statement that you will mark the Application Fee checklist item as complete upon receipt of the check. -- Application Fee Instructions These are the general instructions that display on the Application payment page before a payment method is selected from the drop-down menu. A best practice is to notify families of any additional fees for payment by credit card, as well as the type of credit cards accepted. You can also direct them back to the main Parent Portal page to access the student checklist. -- Application Thank You This is the thank you page that displays after the Application Form is submitted. Best Practices: Direct families back to the Parent Portal to complete the student's admissions checklist. Include links to your website, social media pages, blog subscription, etc. Add images or embed a video. Copy the embed code from the video you wish to add, and then paste it into the code view of the template. Click here for more information. If you would like to use merge fields for personalization, the only one that will pull data is:{{contact.preferred_name_or_first}}, which will pull the student's preferred name or first name if there is no preferred name. Parent name merge fields will not work since the form may not be imported automatically due to a potential duplicate contact from an inquiry record. Autopay Terms And Conditions For schools using the Finalsite Enrollment Billing Module. This is the information that displays to a parent when enrolling into autopay . Best Practices: Information on how a charge is defined How to update or terminate AutoPay information Liability waiver Any other service terms -- Billing Management Widget For schools using the Finalsite Enrollment Billing Module.

Notify families about any convenience fees that you charge for certain payment methods. -- Contact Communication Area This is the area that displays above the student checklist. The information displayed in this area can be dynamic using liquid logic statements/rules - contact our Support Team for help with this! Best Practices: Include deadlines and/or important dates Include links to a viewbook, student handbook, school calendar, etc. Important Note about Display Customization: By default, anything added to this template will be visible to all contacts in an active workflow (i.e. both Admissions and Enrollment families). To customize the information for different sets of families, please work with our best-in-class Support Team so they can set up liquid logic statements/rules for dynamic displays. Some examples include admissions vs. enrollment, new vs. returning families, international vs. domestic, day vs. boarding, etc. See below for some examples. Example for Admissions Statuses Only: Example for Enrollment Statuses Only: -- Contact Page Sidebar This is the fully customizable sidebar that appears when viewing a student's checklist in the Parent Portal. By default, the template includes the contact information you have entered within 'Settings' - 'General' - ' Contact Information ', but it can be updated to whatever you like. Best Practices: List the key admissions, enrollment, and other contacts that families might need to reach during the process. You can pull in the information from the Contact Information setup page using merge tokens , or you can simply type in custom information. Get families excited about your school by displaying engaging images or videos from school events, clubs, and more. Be creative! You can use Liquid logic within this template to show different content based on the type of student. Change it up for upper vs. lower school, international vs. domestic, or even based on student interests. Contact our Support Team for help with setup. -- Contact Page Sidebar Header This is the header that appears above the information you entered in the Contact Page Sidebar (see above). The default is \"Contact [Your School Name]\" but this can be customized as you like. -- Contract Thank You This is the thank you page that displays after the Contract Form is submitted. Best Practices: This template is turned off by default so that the parent/guardian is directed back to the Enrollment Checklist once the contract has been submitted. If you\u2019d like to turn this feature on to display the thank you page, you can navigate to 'Settings' - 'Communication' - ' Communication Setup ', then check the box for 'Contract Thank You Page' and hit save. -- Custom Fee Check Instructions These are the instructions that display on the payment page for any custom/adhoc fees (i.e. fees not tied to the contract) when a check option is selected, if applicable. If you do not offer a paper check as an option, you can leave this template blank. If you do offer a paper check option, include information on who the check should be payable to and the mailing address. You may also want to include a statement that you will mark the associated fee checklist item as complete upon receipt of the check. -- Custom Payment Instructions These are the instructions that display on the payment page when a custom payment method (e.g. wire transfer) is selected, if applicable. If you do not have a custom payment method set up, you can leave this template blank. If you do offer a custom payment method option, include detailed instructions on submitting the payment. You may also want to include a statement that you will mark the associated fee checklist item as complete upon receipt of the payment. -- Deposit Check Instructions These are the instructions that display on the payment page for the contract deposit when a check option is selected, if applicable. If you do not offer a paper check as an option, you can leave this template blank. If you do offer a paper check option, include information on who the check should be payable to and the mailing address. You may also want to include a statement that you will mark the Deposit checklist item as complete upon receipt of the check. See the screenshot below for an example. -- Deposit Instructions These are the general instructions that display on the contract deposit payment page before a payment method is selected from the drop-down menu. A best practice is to notify families of any additional fees for payment by credit card, as well as the type of credit cards accepted. You can also direct them back to the main Parent Portal page to access the student checklist. -- Dual Signature Instructions The dual signature instructions will only display if your school is using the Dual Signature feature on the contract. Once the first parent signs the contract, they are automatically redirected to a page where they can invite a second signer. The instructions are displayed on this page above the invite button. If the parent leaves the page and returns later to the checklist, they will still see these instructions when selecting the 'Invite another signer' button. -- Inquiry Thank You This is the thank you page that displays after the Inquiry Form is submitted. You can use this page, as well as the automated ' Inquiry Thank You Email ', to increase your conversions by showcasing your value proposition. Best Practices: Thank the family for their interest!

Click here for more information on these links. Let families know you'll be reaching out and any additional steps in the process. Provide links to different social media pages and/or important pages on your website. Invite families to view or subscribe to your blog or newsletter via provided links.

Best Practices: Make it warm and friendly. Include information on why parents are creating an account and what they can manage in the Parent Portal. Include contact information. If someone has trouble logging in, they know who to contact without needing to look for a phone number on your website. The contact information in the Parent Portal isn't displayed until after they've successfully logged in. Include information for first time users to check their email address before creating their account to ensure they don't mistype it upon account creation. Remember, first-time users who manually create an account (rather than creating an account through SSO), will receive a verification email and must verify their account within 24hrs. Pay Now Instructions These are the instructions that display if a parent uses the \"Pay Now\" button on a form fee or deposit checklist item. Click here for more information. -- Portal Widget This is the messaging that displays above the student list after someone has logged into their account, but before they have clicked into a specific student in the Parent Portal. Best Practices: Make it warm and friendly. If your admissions season is only open for a defined period of time, you can let parents know when applications will be accepted and available online. Link to the Parent Portal Online Help Center in the upper right, as noted by the 'Help' icon, which answers a list of FAQs that parents can use throughout the process. You can drive traffic to this page in this template so that parents can help during off-hours when they're working on forms and checklist items in the evening. An example is provided in the image above. -- Summary Page Sidebar This is the fully customizable sidebar that appears next to the student list after someone has logged into their account, but before they have clicked into a specific student in the Parent Portal. By default, the template includes the contact information you have entered within 'Settings' - 'General' - ' Contact Information ', but it can be updated to whatever you like. Best Practices: List the key admissions, enrollment, and other contacts that families might need to reach during the process. You can pull in the information from the Contact Information setup page using merge tokens , or you can simply type in custom information. Get families excited about your school by displaying engaging images or videos from school events, clubs, and more. -- Summary Page Header This is the header that appears above the information you entered in the Summary Page Sidebar (see above). The default is \"Contact [Your School Name]\" but this can be customized as you like. Shared Portal Page Please Note This template is only available to schools utilizing the Shared Portal option. The Shared Portal Page template is where you can customize the main content about your school that displays on the Explorer page when your school is selected. This template has the same functionality as the others in that you can edit the text in a variety of ways, insert images, and embed videos. You can also use the code editor to make more advanced adjustments to the template. Best practices for making your Finalsite Explore page shine. Keep this page up to date. Be sure to include important deadlines and details that prospective families should know about. Add links for families to register for highlighted events. Design your page to stand out. Admissions and Enrollment Settings Enable/Disable Enrollment and Admissions Checklists for Parents Below the Parent Portal Templates are Enrollment and Admissions Settings. To manage these settings, use the checkbox next to them and make sure to hit Save at the bottom after making any changes. Parent enrollment enabled: Turning this off means parents cannot access their enrollment checklist or contract/registration form, which is contained within the checklist. Even if you generate contracts with this turned off, parents will not be able to view anything until you mark the checkbox to enable parent access. Important Notes For all schools: Parents are not automatically notified when this setting is turned on or off. If you are opening or closing enrollment, consider sending a notification to inform them of the change. For Billing schools: If parent enrollment is disabled, the Billing Management tab within the Parent Portal is still available. The Billing Management tab cannot be disabled or turned off. Parent admissions application enabled: This allows families to submit application forms. This setting does not grant access to the checklist. Unchecking this option turns off the ability for families to submit applications. In the Parent Portal: New Users : On their first time logging in, they will only see the Authenication code button and not a button with the option to submit an application. Existing Users : When a parent selects the button to submit an application, they will see a message that says \"The application is not open at this time.\" In Finalsite Explore: T he Apply Now button in Finalsite Explore will no longer appear on your Explore School's page. Wherever a URL link to your Application is shared : Parents will be directed to the Parent Portal and will see a message that says \"The application is not open at this time.\" Parent admissions workflow enabled: The admissions workflow is the application checklist. If you turned the parent admissions application off so that no new families can apply, then it would be a best practice to leave the admissions workflow enabled (turned on) so that families that did submit an application form can still access their checklist and complete it. Click save to apply your changes. Analytics Termly Finalsite Enrollment utilizes Termly for consent management. Consent is usually achieved via an automatic pop-up that appears on a webpage, informing users of how their personal information will or will not be saved and used on that site.

    "body": "Overview Within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Setup you can customize email settings and enable or disable some automated communications. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: System Admins and Admins Permissions: Communication In this article Email Automatic Emails and Communication Pages Failed Email Notifications Email In the top section of the Communication Setup page are some general settings that apply to all of the emails you send through the Finalsite Enrollment system: Email Reply-To: The email address that will receive the reply if a contact receives an email from your school and opts to reply to it. Although this email address will display by default, it can be changed manually within a bulk or individual email communication before it is sent out. Email From: Text that displays in an email's \u201cfrom\u201d field when it is sent/received. Setting the Email From field to your school's name is a good idea. When a contact receives an email from your school, this text will display before your Finalsite Enrollment email address. For Example: If your Email From field is saved as \"Claire's Training Academy\", the parent would see something very similar to this in the 'from' section when receiving an email: From: Claire's Training Academy &lt;info+clairestraining@fsenrollment.com&gt; Automatic Emails and Communication Pages The next section includes settings related to the automatic system emails and pages that trigger at different points in the admissions and/or enrollment process. Some of these emails have customizable templates, which can be edited from Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates in the System Emails tab. Application Thank You Email: Automated email sent to the email address of the portal account that is logged in when the application form is submitted. This email is customizable under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; System Emails. Inquiry Thank You Email: Automated email sent to the contact selected in the \"Send Inquiry Thank You Email to\" setting (noted below) when the inquiry form is submitted. This email is customizable under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; System Emails. Contract Thank You Email: Automated email sent to the email address of the portal account that is logged in when the contract form is submitted. When sent, this email will show on the Sent Emails page, but not on the student record. This email is customizable under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; System Emails. Please note: Even when enabled with this page, Contract Thank You emails are only sent automatically if the contract submission is performed by the parent. Bulk contract submissions by an admin or contracts subjected to countersign will not trigger the system Contract Thank You Email. If you are using the countersign or bulk submission feature and would like to learn how to set up an automatic communication plan to trigger a Thank You email post-contract completion, please refer to this article within the How-To Set Up an Automatic Contract Thank You Email section. Application Fee Receipt: Automated email sent to the email address of the portal account that is logged in when the application form is submitted, confirming receipt of the application fee. Includes the amount paid (incl. any convenience fees), date, and order number, as well as the name and portal link for your school. This email is not customizable. Deposit Receipt: Automated email sent to the email address of the portal account that is logged in when the contract form is submitted, confirming receipt of the deposit/registration fee. Includes the amount paid (incl. any convenience fees), date, and order number, as well as the name and portal link for your school. This email is not customizable. Contract Thank You Page: Page which displays after the contract is submitted, thanking the parent/guardian for completing the contract. This is turned off by default so that families are automatically redirected to the enrollment checklist. This landing page is customizable under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Content.

    "body": "Overview This article provides a step-by-step guide on how to conduct a lottery using the Lottery feature in Finalsite Enrollment. It covers testing the lottery process and accessing the results for viewing or presentation purposes. Check out our Lottery Settings article to learn how to customize your lottery settings and presentation Who has access to this? Types: System Admin and Admin Permissions: Any In this Article Setting up your Tiers Setting up your Lottery Running your Lottery Presenting the Results Setting up your Tiers Before running a lottery, you will need to set up tiers. What are tiers? Tiers are a collection of saved searches that you use in the lottery to tailor how students are selected. Example: If your school would like to separate students with siblings enrolled, students with faculty parents, and general admission, your tiers might look like this: Tier 1 (saved search): All applicants who have siblings enrolled in the school. Tier 2 (saved search): All applicants whose parents work at the school. Tier 3 (saved search): All students in an Applicant or Application Complete status. How to set up your tiers Navigate to the Search page (Search &amp; Reports &gt; Search) Select the correct term. Add your criteria. Start the search with the criteria that the students should be Applicants or Application Complete statuses. (Students must be in either an applicant or application complete status to be eligible for the lottery.) Add to the criteria to set the standard for your tier. For example, if you are basing part of the lottery on students with faculty parents, pull in the field that will identify that group. Please note: this, of course, means that you must already have a field set up that can differentiate the group you are looking for. Save your Search . Start the name of your search with its tier level followed by a clear identifier. For example: Tier 1 - Faculty Student. Notes about tiers The final tier should be set to the criteria \" status is applicant or application complete \". This will be a catch-all for all other students that did not meet any of the tier criteria. Important: Each year you need to go into the saved searches, update the term to the following year, and update the saved search so that when you run the lottery that year, it's pulling in the correct group of students. Setting up your Lottery To run a new lottery, view past lotteries, or present results, navigate to Settings &gt; Lottery &gt; Lottery in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Click on the Run a Lottery button in the top left to get started. In the dialog box, you will see the following options. Understanding the Lottery Options Test Lottery This allows you to run the lottery in test mode. When checked, the system will perform all steps of the lottery except the final step of changing a student's status. This is useful in testing your lottery tiers or weighting system. Note: Test Lotteries can be deleted after running them. Apply Year Here, you can set the apply year of the lottery you'd like to run. Apply Grade This allows you to set the apply grade of the lottery you\u2019d like to run. Lottery Option 1? Please note This option only appears if you have enabled the Partition lotteries &amp; waitlists by lottery_option_1? option within the Lottery Settings page. Lotteries are siloed by 2 criteria: Apply Grade and Apply Year. Lottery option 1? is a partition so you can add a third criterion to your lottery such as campus or gender. The third criterion would be set up as lottery option 1 on the back end of the system, and it would display as a column in the lottery page so that the lottery is now filtered by all 3 criteria. Accept how many students? Here, you can set the number of students you\u2019re going to accept for the apply year and grade selected. Automatically accept siblings? This allows you to choose how to handle siblings. You can choose from the following options: No All siblings Siblings in the same grade Siblings in higher grades If selecting All siblings or Siblings in the same grade , you have the option to also automatically waitlist same-grade siblings together Next, you can choose between doing a Tiered Lottery or a Weighted Lottery : Tiered Lottery This allows you to select the tiered searches that the lottery will run off of. Weighted Lottery With this option, in addition to your tiered searches, Weighted Lottery allows you to set a weight for each tier. The lottery will then create a total weight for each student based on the tiers in which they appear. Adding Tiered Searches After selecting whether you'd like to run a tiered or weighted lottery, you'll start pulling in the saved searches you built to guide your tiers. Is there a limit to how many tiers I can add? Yes and no. Technically, you'll run into some issues if you try to add more than 30 tiers but it's rather unlikely that you'd need more than that amount to begin with so, have no fear when selecting your tiers. Tiered Lottery If you selected to run a Tiered Lottery , open the Select Saved Search dropdown and select your first tiered search. Pro tip: this is where giving it a clear and recognizable name comes in handy. Once you've selected your first tier, continue to add your additional tiers by selecting the Add Tier? option and pulling in the next level tier from the dropdown of saved searches. If you select the wrong tier you do have the option to remove it. Weighted Lottery If you select to run a Weighted Lottery , you'll set a weight for each tier that you pull in. Enter the weight into the box above the search dropdown and then choose your saved tier search below. Please note: The weight must be entered as a whole number. This box does not accept decimals. Running your Lottery When you run a lottery, students are automatically moved into one of two statuses based on the outcome: Accepted and Waitlisted. A few important reminders: If you have selected Test lottery? no change will be made to the student's status. Your Waitlist can also be viewed from the Admissions tab ( Admissions &gt; Waitlist ). Custom columns can be added to the Lottery Results page from the List Page Configuration setup page ( Settings &gt; General &gt; List Page Configuration ). About Statuses: Accepted and Waitlisted Neither of these statuses is visible to parents. Here's what the parents will see for both: If the parent hasn't completed all of their checklist items: Parents will see the \"Applying for X Grade in [Term]\" message and still have access to their checklist. If the parent has completed all of their required checklist items: The parent will see the \"Application Complete\" message and still have access to their checklist. Once the lottery is finished, click View to see which students were moved to Accepted or Waitlisted status. Hidden names and/or birthdates In the Lottery Settings , you can opt to hide student names and/or birthdates. If you selected to hide the name, the student's name in the Contact column will appear blank on this page until you click the Reveal Student Names button above the list. Presenting the Results Presentation mode allows you to display the presentation for parents or in front of your auditors to give a visual demonstration of the lottery. To view the lottery presentation, select Presentation on your Lottery page. Schools operating remotely can run this presentation and then share their screen, so that parents and students can watch over Zoom, Google Meet, etc. Please note: The link to the presentation should not be shared with anyone outside of your Finalsite Enrollment users, as it will prompt them to log in to your Admin Portal upon clicking it. Once the Acceptance Lottery presentation has played, you will be able to start a Waitlist Lottery presentation. A few closing notes on the Lottery presentation By default, the presentation mode will show each student's name, lottery result, and birthdate. Within the Lottery Settings page, you have the option to hide student names (and replace them with a unique Lottery ID for each student) and/or hide student birthdates when presenting your lottery. Please note: in order for an ID to populate, one must be set up. To set this ID value for students, you can either (1) import it into the lottery_id field, (2) update it manually on the student contact record, or (3) have our Support Team set the field to auto-generate. Waitlisted students will have their waitlist position number listed. If the lottery was run as a test lottery, this will be indicated on the presentation mode as well. To change how many rows to display, fade-in/fade-out times, or delays on the lottery presentation, go to your Lottery Settings .

    "body": "Overview For schools using the Lottery feature, there are some additional settings you can configure within the Lottery Settings page (Settings &gt; Lottery &gt; Lottery Settings). Here, you can tailor what information is displayed on both the waitlist and lottery results screens. Additionally, you can set up various visual preferences for the lottery presentation. Don't forget to click Save on any changes before exiting this page! Who has access to this? Types: System Admin and Admin Permissions: Any In this article Additional Data Displayed on Waitlist &amp; Lottery Results Lottery Presentation Miscellaneous Additional Data Displayed on Waitlist &amp; Lottery Results Siblings that are also applicants? When this option is checked, the siblings that are also applicants of the students in the lottery will display on the view screen and on the waitlist pages within the Admissions tab. Siblings that are also students? When this option is checked, the siblings of the students in the lottery that are current students in the school will display on the view screen and on the waitlist pages within the Admissions tab. Lottery Presentation Maximum student rows to display at once This is the maximum number of student rows you want to display at once in the presentation mode. Fade in animation time This is the animation time for all of the results to fade in during the presentation, which are set in milliseconds. Fade out animation time This is the animation time for all of the results to fade out during the presentation, which are set in milliseconds. Student info heading delay This is how long each students name and position is displayed on the screen along the left. Student info row delay This is how long each students name and additional information is displayed in the row format along the right of the heading. Final result delay This is how long the results will display before moving onto the lottery is complete page. Hide student name When checked, names will be replaced with the value in the Lottery ID (lottery_id) field when you present the results. This option is useful if your school runs your lottery and presentation live in front of families. You can provide each family with their student's unique ID, so they will be the only ones to know if they were accepted or waitlisted. Please note: For the ID to populate, you must have it set up. To set this ID value for students, you can either (1) import it into the lottery_id field, (2) update it manually on the student contact record, or (3) have our Support Team set the field to auto-generate. Hide student birth date When checked, this option will hide the student's birth date when you present the lottery results. Miscellaneous Partition lotteries and waitlists by lottery_option_1? When you enable this priority option and have students with the relevant field filled out, the lottery will prioritize those students first. Only students meeting the priority criteria will be considered in the lottery. For example: Your Lottery Option 1 field includes \"International,\" and you have marked students who meet this criterion by selecting \"International\" in their Lottery Option 1 field. You set the lottery to prioritize \"International.\" When you run the lottery: The system will first check if students have \"International\" in their Lottery Option 1 field. Among the students who do have \"International\" selected, the system will randomly select students to accept, based on the number of available spaces and the tier (saved searches) prioroties. Students who do not meet this criterion will be automatically waitlisted. How to set up the Lottery Option 1 priority Update the Field: Go to the fields page and search for \"lottery_option_1.\" Edit the field values to include the options you want the lottery to prioritize (e.g., \"International\"). You can add multiple options, but you will select only one for the lottery. Update the Lottery Settings: In the lottery settings, check the box for \u201cPartition lotteries &amp; waitlists by lottery_option_1.\u201d On the Student Records: For all students that meet your priority setting, update their \"lottery_option_1\" field to include the selected criteria. You can update students individually (on their records). The \"lottery_option_1\" field is located on the student records under the personal tab. You can also update this field in bulk from the admissions list page. Read how to update fields in bulk here: Bulk Updates When Running the Lottery: Select your priority option from the \"Lottery Option 1\" dropdown.

    "body": "Overview Did you know? Did you know that you can create and edit your own fields? Check out this article to learn more: Creating and Editing Fields. Within Finalsite Enrollment, fields are the containers that store specific data about students, parents, or other contacts in the system. To learn more about what fields are and how they work, click here . This article will detail how to adjust various settings for your fields, so you can manage how they appear and are organized within your Finalsite Enrollment site. Please note, you do not have the ability to delete fields on your end. If you need to delete a field, please reach out to our Support Team . Click to jump to: How to get to the Fields Setup page Hide From Form How to view and edit field settings How to rearrange the order of fields How to examine a field's usage How-To: View &amp; Navigate the Fields Setup Page To view your full list of fields, navigate to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields . Please note: This page will only be accessible to Admins/System Admins . This page, also known as the Fields Setup Page, contains a list of every field in your Finalsite Enrollment site. This contains both standard fields (e.g. Name, Grade, etc.) as well as any custom fields you have requested be created. Search or Filter for a Field To search for a particular field or field type within this page, click on the blue 'Filter Options' button near the top of the page. When the filter options expand, you will see the following: Search: Allows you to search by text by typing a full or partial field name into the search box. Grouping: Allows you to search by specific field groupings (e.g. Personal Information, Review, etc.) by checking the boxes. This is a multi-select filter, so you can check as many boxes as you want to filter by. Field Type: Allows you to search by specific field types (e.g. Scholarship field, Date field, etc.) by checking the boxes. This is a multi-select filter, so you can check as many boxes as you want to filter by. Once you have selected the filter options you want to use, click on the blue ' Apply Filter' button . If you want to go back to the default view, you can click the red 'Clear Filters' button . How-To: View &amp; Edit Field Settings Within the Fields Setup page, you can see the different elements displayed as columns. You can also edit some of this information by clicking on the Edit button to the right of any field to open the Field Details window. Within the Field Details window , you will see the following information: Display Name: Name of the field as you will see it displayed on contact records and within search &amp; reports , as well as some other spots such as the template editor , communication plan steps , etc. The Display Name can be changed by your internal team, and does not affect what is seen on forms. The way a field is displayed on forms is through a prompt - click here for more information. Name: Canonical name of the field that is used on the back-end of the system. It will always be all lowercase with underscores instead of spaces. The canonical name is used for pulling information into merge fields / tokens , as well as in online forms , contact imports , data exports . Once a field is created, the canonical name cannot be changed . CType: The type of field, which determines what data inputs are allowed in the field. For example, a DateField requires a formatted date, while a TextField allows anything to be typed into it. Once a field is created, the type cannot be changed - a new field with the updated type will have to be created instead. Click here to learn about the different field types in the system. Grouping: Indicates the specific grouping in which a field will appear within the Personal , Admissions , or Enrollment tab of the contact record . The field grouping also determines where you will locate a field within the Change Display/Columns window in Search &amp; Reports . Field groupings can be changed by your internal team, although some standard fields (e.g. name, address, birthdate) have a hard-coded grouping and cannot be edited. The visibility of groupings and the fields contained within also pertain to user viewing permissions as defined in the Admin Portal Accounts page . Note on the 'Hidden' field grouping: Assigning a field to this grouping hides it from the contact record. This is mostly used for retired fields that your school is no longer using. The grouping can be set to Hidden, instead of deleting the field, so that any historical data will still be kept in the system if needed for a historical search. Searchable: This checkbox determines if the field can be searched on and displayed as a column on the Search &amp; Reports page. Your internal team can toggle whether fields are searchable or not by checking/unchecking this option. When building a search, the field can be located in the All other fields search criteria , as long as you have access to view that grouping. If you are unsure where to locate the field in the change display/columns window, refer to the grouping of the field within this Fields page, as it will match the grouping of displayed columns in Search. Term-based: This checkbox determines if the data stored in the field is term-based, i.e. it can hold a unique set of data for each academic year. Term-based fields clear out each year when you roll students over to the next term. Term-based fields may only be mapped to the student as parents and other entities do not have a term. Once a field is set as term-based, it can not be undone. To learn more, visit our Term-Based Fields &amp; Enrollment Refresh page. Term-based fields clear out each year when you roll students over to the next term. Hide From Form: If you select \"Hide From Form\" for a field used in a form, its value will be hidden when admins are viewing the form. Read more below. Options: A list of options will appear only for certain field types, such as boolean, booleanlist, or single select. These are the options available to choose from for this field on a form or in the contact record. Internal Description: A short description of the field. This is optional. If you add an internal description to a field, it will display on the Fields page within the description column when hovering over the icon. Contact Layout: Indicates which contact record types will have the field displayed. For example, if you are collecting specific field data on your Contract, you may only want to display those fields for contacts in the 'Enrollment' contact type, or you may only want to display work information for contacts in the 'Parent' contact type. The contact layout options can be changed by your internal team by checking or unchecking the boxes. For a faster way to change the contact layout options for all of your different fields, use the 'Contact Layout' page within Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data . Hide From Form When Hide From Form is selected for a field, it conceals the value of that field from admins when they view it on a form. For instance, in the image below, both the Gender field and the Applicant's Birth Date field have Hide From Form enabled. Consequently, when an admin views the form, they will not see the data stored in those fields. When \"Hide From Form\" is selected: Parents will still be able to see the data within the field on their end. Regardless of an admin's permission level, whenever they view forms on the record, download the PDF version of the form, or check out the form in the review module, they will encounter 'Hidden From View' instead of the actual data for any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled. This only applies to viewing the field on a form. Any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled will continue to display its data within searches, on the contact record (if the field is visible in the Contact Widget or within tabs like Personal, Admissions, or Enrollment ), in emails, and any other location where the field is displayed. The information is only hidden from admin when the view the field on a form. Good to know: Hide Form Form is reversible. You can de-select ' Hide From Form' in the field settings at any time and, as soon as you do so, the data will start to display again. How-To: Rearrange Field Order Fields can be arranged in a custom order on the contact record (shown below) within the Personal, Admissions, and Enrollment tabs, based on the order they appear in the Fields List Page. To rearrange the order in which your fields appear, follow these steps: Navigate to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields . Click the 'Filter Options' button , select the grouping you would like to rearrange, and then click 'Apply Filter' button . Click here for more information on this step. Rearrange the fields by hovering over the field until you see the cross arrow symbol, then drag and drop the field to the desired position. Check a contact record to see the applied changes! You can also rearrange fields from the Contact Layout page. Click here for more information. How-To: Examine Field Usage To see the different places a field is being used in the system, click on the 'Examine' button to the right of any field to open the Field Examine page for it. This will show you if the field is being used on forms, saved searches, exports, email snippets, and more. In addition, for any composite fields (i.e. fields made up of various subfields), such as phone numbers and names, you can see the specific canonical names for each subfield. This is helpful if you want to pull in the information from a specific subfield (e.g. phone type or name title) on a template, export, etc. instead of pulling in the entire field.

How-To: Use the Contact Layout Page To access this page, navigate to 'Settings' - 'Fields &amp; Data' - 'Contact Layout'. Here you will see the columns listed below. Name: The display name of the field is listed first, with the canonical name listed underneath that. Grouping: The grouping category that the field is contained within. This determines where it will appear on the contact record. To learn more about field groupings, click here . Role Categories: The role category columns allow you to customize which fields are displayed or hidden for each role or stage of the Admissions/Enrollment process. This is useful because you can make sure you are only seeing the specific fields that are relevant to each type of contact. For example, you may only want to show work information fields for parent contacts, or only show fields that appear on your contract for students in the enrollment phase. For any field on the list, you can check the boxes for the contact types who that field should appear for within the contact record. Hover over each field name and the role categories will display for that row of checkboxes. Your changes on this page will be saved automatically. Field Order: Fields can be arranged on a contact record in a custom order based on the order they appear on this page. Please note that fields are first arranged by their grouping, and then by the order within that grouping. Hover over the field name and you will see the cross arrow cursor. You can then click, drag, and drop the field to the desired position in the list.

    "body": "Important! Before attempting any import into your SIS, please make sure your database is backed up! Overview When exporting data, you need a saved search to tell the system what contacts you'd like to export. The most common export we see is to update your SIS with the new students that came into your school and to update existing data for your returning students. Schools vary on what they consider an 'enrolled' student. Although families have an entire checklist of items they need to complete for the enrollment process, the Business Office might consider a student 'enrolled' as long as their Contract/Registration Forms are submitted, and their Deposits are paid. If your school integrates with FACTS, the completion of this step may also be a part of your search. Getting Started To get started with your data export, you'll first need an export file setup with the fields you need from Finalsite Enrollment for your other system. You may already have a file that was created for you during the implementation process. If not, or if you need a new file created, work with Finalsite Enrollment Support and a Configuration specialist to create your data export file. IMPORTANT NOTE: Every implementation includes one complimentary export and any additional exports comes at an additional cost. Please contact Support or a Configuration Specialist for pricing. The standard custom data export service level agreement from receipt of final requirements is 6-8 weeks . Depending on the system you're exporting data to, you'll need to start with one of the templates listed below. If you do not integrate with Blackbaud or Veracross, you will use the first template in the list. Data Export Template Blackbaud API Data Dictionary Veracross API Data Dictionary Build Your Search Start within the Search &amp; Reports page to build your search criteria. We'll use the Enrolled student example explained above. Select the enrollment status of Enrollment in Progress and add in your checklist items and/or any other criteria needed for your definition of an ' Enrolled ' student. If you currently have some students that are fully enrolled, then you'll want to include that status in your search as well. You can create one search for new and returning students, or create a separate search for new students and a separate search for returning students. Once you click on the ' Search ' button to populate your results then ' Save ' your search and name it. Now your search will be available when you export your data. Create your Data Export Navigate to Settings (1) \u2013 Fields and Data (2) \u2013 Data Export (3) . 2. Click Run an Export as shown below. 3. Configure the criteria for your export as explained below: Choose the Export Configuration (1) from the dropdown menu. This is typically named after your SIS such as Blackbaud Export. Type (2) : This is pre-set for you. Search (3) : Choose any search you have saved. The search is used to set the filters for the export. The column headers will always be the same as long as you use the same export configuration, regardless of which search you use. Which records (4) : Pick one of the following: All Records: This option will pull all records that meet the criteria of the search. Since last export: Selecting this option will export only new records entered into the Finalsite Enrollment system since your last export. This does not include existing records that have been modified. See below for more information on how this feature works. 4. Click Export (5) to run it. How the \u201cSince Last Export\u201d feature works: This feature is specific to the configuration being used. Once you run the export for the first time and mark it as exported, the next time you run that export you will only see new records that fit the search criteria. This prevents you from exporting data that was already imported into your SIS. If your school has multiple export configurations, each configuration will need to be marked as exported so that you only return the newest results. 1. To set this feature, first click on View on the far right of the Data Export page, next to the export file you wish to view. 2. On the View page, the user must click on \u201c Mark as exported \u201d after each export for the configuration to run. We strongly recommend only clicking this button once the records have been successfully imported into their target system. This sets up the configuration so that the next time this export is run, the \u201cSince Last Export\u201d feature will know which records were exported last. 3. After \u201cMark as Exported\u201d has been enabled, go to Run an Export . 4. In the dialogue box, go to Which Records (1) and select Since last export (2) from the dropdown menu to export only new records. Click export (3) to run it.",

    "body": "Overview At different points in the year, you may need to update demographic data, financial aid, test scores, or other fields for a large group of students. Data Imports can be used to easily update information for existing contacts (e.g. students or parents) in your Finalsite Enrollment system. This article will go over how to create a bulk update import template to be used in your Update-type data imports. If you want to create new contacts through an import, click here to learn how . -- How-To: Create a Bulk Update Template 1 - Create a Search The first step in creating your bulk update template is to create a search through Search &amp; Reports that isolates the records (contacts) you want to update. For this example, we will create a search to update the financial aid and scholarship fields for Enrollment in Progress students. Select your search criteria from the drop-down menus in the Search &amp; Reports page, and then click the blue Search button to run it. Here is an example of a search for all students that are currently Enrollment in Progress status for the 2019-2020 term: 2 - Pull Desired Fields in as Displayed Columns Once you have confirmed that you have the set of records (contacts) you want to update pulled into the search, click on the blue Change Display / Columns button in the upper right of the search page. A pop-up window will display that will allow you to choose from the fields in your Finalsite Enrollment system. You will want to select all of the fields that you intend to update for the group of students. You can do this by checking the box next to the field name that you want to include. After selecting all of the desired fields, click the blue Apply button to confirm. For our example, we will display fields within the 'Scholarship' and 'Tuition Assistance' groupings as shown in the screenshot below. Please note: If some of the data you want to update does not already have an associated field in Finalsite Enrollment, you can include those fields manually at a later time. After hitting the Apply button, the search page will refresh and you will see your search results with any selected fields displayed as columns. 3 - Export the Search Data Once you have all of the students and fields that you want to update pulled into your search, click the green Export button in the upper right of the search page and select the Export as Import Template option. A pop-up will appear with a message saying the export is being processed. Once the export is complete, you will see a link that you can click and download the file. Once you download and open the exported template file, you will notice the CHILD.id as the leftmost column. This is the Finalsite Enrollment ID of the student and is what allows you to easily import the data back into the system. 4 - Enter the Update Data Now that you have the base of your bulk update import template, you can begin entering the data you want to update for the students in the appropriate columns. There are a few things to keep in mind when filling in this data: If the field already exists in Finalsite Enrollment and it only accepts specific values (such as a drop-down field on a form), please ensure all values listed in the file are valid and written exactly as they exist in Finalsite Enrollment. If invalid values are provided for a field, the import will fail until the value is corrected. Field values are case sensitive. If the field does not yet exist in Finalsite Enrollment and only accepts specific values, please contact Support with the field name, field type (e.g. open text, single-select, etc.), and the field values if applicable. Indicate in your message to the team that this field does not exist in Finalsite Enrollment yet. If this field belongs on a form, please indicate which form you would like it on, and what you want the prompt on the form to read. If there are any fields in the file that are simply for reference and do not contain any updated data, such as student name, indicate that these fields can be omitted from the update by replacing the word ' CHILD ' with the word ' IGNORE ' in the column headers followed by the period and the respective field name with underscores. If you only have a few records you need to change the name for, it is recommended to make these changes directly in Finalsite Enrollment on an individual basis. Once you have your file saved, you are ready to import it into the Finalsite Enrollment system.

    "body": "When you request an export configuration for your site, we send you a data dictionary to complete. The data dictionary is where you can specify which fields in your Student Information System (SIS) you want to import data into, which fields the data should come from on our end, and any specific formatting requirements. Essentially, this document helps our team build an export that meets all your needs. It typically takes about 6-8 weeks for us to build an export from the initial conversations to the final product. Data Dictionary Template Overview You will be provided with a data dictionary template by Finalsite Enrollment. The 'dictionary' is a spreadsheet file that you will open in a software like Google Sheets or Excel. Within the data dictionary, you'll enter information about what fields you want to send information to in your SIS and what fields they should come from in our system. Below is an example image from one of our Data Dictionaries (depending on which type of export we are building for you, the dictionary file you receive might look different from the one pictured below.) Data Dictionary FAQ What fields should I include in the data dictionary? You don't need to include every field from your SIS in the data dictionary. You only need to include the fields that you want to send information into. [Note: Only data that is relevant to the admissions or enrollment process should be collected in Finalsite Enrollment. Any data that is related to post-enrollment processes (such as class schedules or attendance) should continue to be maintained outside of Finalsite Enrollment.] At a minimum, you should include the following fields (if they exist in your system): The unique identifier used to update records in your target system when importing data. This varies from system to system, however, in many cases this would be a Student ID with the format: 123456. Any fields your target system indicates are required when importing data. My file has a Reference Table tab. What is that for? Sometimes the values in the fields in your SIS will be different from the values of the field in Finalsite Enrollment. The most common examples we see of this are grade, ethnicity/race, country/citizenship, marital status, and gender. Are any of the values for these or other fields in your dictionary different in Finalsite Enrollment compared to your SIS? If yes, please complete a table for it! If my target system requires multiple files for import, do I need to fill out more than one data dictionary? For each file you need to import into your target system, include a separate tab in the data dictionary worksheet with the field names, sample values, and descriptions required for that specific file. All reference tables can be combined onto one tab. Library of Resources Article: How to Find Fields Article: How to Find Field Values Video: How to complete a generic data dictionary * *Please note: this video covers our standard, generic data dictionary but you might be completing one of our customized dictionaries, so, the dictionary you receive may not match the one in the video. Glossary Data Dictionary - The requirements document Finalsite Enrollment needs to configure your custom export and build your Finalsite Enrollment site. This is to be filled out and returned by the school before the export build process. Target system - The Student Information System (SIS) or other system of record that you want to import data from Finalsite Enrollment into. You may have multiple systems you track data in, but for the purposes of Finalsite Enrollment \u201ctarget system\u201d refers specifically to the system or systems you have purchased a custom export configuration for. Custom export configuration - A framework of data transformation used to correctly output a file (or multiple files) with headers and data that matches what your target system expects for an import Reference Table - A list of valid values for a specific field. If a field uses codes instead of display names, the reference table should include both the display name and the valid value accepted by the target system.",

    "body": "Overview Our current integration with SAO is a two-part integration. When a student submits the initial SSATB application and pays the fee online, the integration imports the contact with an applicant status, and also creates a small database application file in Finalsite Enrollment, which is a stripped-down version of our normal application. This allows admins to use the system to email the student or their parents, as well as print letters and labels for them. Each student is imported into the system with an applicant status. The following information is imported with the student: Student Name Gender Gender Self Identify Grade Applying Year Applying Father Name, Home Phone, Work Phone, Cell Phone, and Email Mother Name, Home Phone, Work Phone, Cell Phone, and Email Primary Address Parent 3 Name, Home Phone, Work Phone, Cell Phone, and Email (if applicable) Parent 4 Name, Home Phone, Work Phone, Cell Phone, and Email (if applicable) Household 2 address (if applicable) If your school is not using Expanded Gender Options in Finalsite Enrollment, and the applicant selects 'Self-Identify' or 'Prefer not to Respond' in the Gender field within their SAO app, the data will not come over to Finalsite Enrollment. Click to jump to: Mapping Additional Student Fields Recommended Field Mappings Processing &amp; Managing Files Viewing the Application Source for Students Sending Communications to SAO Applicants How-To: Map Additional Student Fields from SSATB It is possible to map additional fields from the SSATB application to feed into specified Finalsite Enrollment fields. IMPORTANT: Before you set up the field mapping, please confirm that your field values in SAO match those in Finalsite Enrollment. To set up your field mapping, navigate to Settings - Fields &amp; Data - SAO Integration. Near the bottom of this page, you'll see an option for SSAT Field Mapping. Click on the Edit Field Mapping button to open the SSATB Field Mapping window. In the SSATB Field Mapping window, you will see a list of student fields from the SSATB application that can be mapped to associated fields in Finalsite Enrollment. Simply use the drop-down menus provided to find the appropriate associated Finalsite Enrollment field by either scrolling through the list or typing the name of the field. See the section below for recommended field mappings. Once you've mapped your desired fields, click the green Submit button to save your changes. Important please keep the following in mind when setting up field mappings: There are a couple of fields we do not recommend mapping. Please do not map these fields when setting up your field mapping: InterestResidentialStatus YearOfProposedEntrance For the data that you are mapping from SAO to Finalsite Enrollment, the field values must match exactly. If the value of the field you are mapping from SAO does not exactly match what you have set up in Finalsite Enrollment, the data will not pass over. For Example: (scenario: in SAO you are mapping the Ethnicity field over to Finalsite Enrollment) &gt; In SAO, one of your values is \"White\" but if you have \"Caucasian\" listed in Finalsite Enrollment, the data will throw an error and not update. Click here to review an entire list of SAO field mappings and their values. After the fields have been mapped, information will be automatically pulled from each applicant's SSATB application into their existing Finalsite Enrollment record at the scheduled daily automatic update time. In the case where information already exists in Finalsite Enrollment for a mapped field, that data will be preserved and not overwritten by data from SSATB. Recommended Field Mappings We recommend mapping the SAO fields in the table below to Finalsite Enrollment fields. Pro Tip: You can review an entire list of SAO field mappings and their values in this spreadsheet. SAO Field Name Finalsite Enrollment Field - Display Name Finalsite Enrollment Field - Canonical Name Field Type in Finalsite Enrollment Notes Ethnicity Ethnicity race_ss SingleSelectField race_ss is a newer field. Your site may still have the following field name in Finalsite Enrollment: ethnicity Current School Enrollment Type School Status school_1_status_ss SingleSelectField school_1 is a newer version of this field. You may still see current_school for this field. Visa Required Requires F1 Visa intl_visa_yn BooleanField Parent Marital Status Primary Household Marital Status marital_status SingleSelectField Apply Fin Aid Financial Aid Requested financial_aid_requested BooleanField Student Email Address Email email EmailField Current School Current School Name (other) school_1_txt TextField school_1 is a newer version of this field.

You may still see current_school for this field. Pronouns Preferred Pronoun preferred_pronoun SingleSelect If you find that your site does not have a field listed above, contact our Support Team to get it added. If you find that you are currently using a different field that houses the same information, verify that the field type of the field in your system matches the field type listed above. You also want to verify that the values match if the field type is 'SingleSelectField'. The remaining fields may need to be created within your Finalsite Enrollment site and must be mapped to specific types of fields: SAO Field Field Type Required in Finalsite Enrollment Country of Birth TextField Native Language TextField Country of Citizenship TextField Interest Category (1-5) SingleSelectField Interest Activity (1-5) TextField Interest Future Involvement (1-5) SingleSelectField Sex At Birth SingleSelectField My Preferred Pronouns TextField Ethnicity Other Detail TextField OMB Ethnicity Group SingleSelectField Interest Residential Status* SingleSelectField Apply Status** *In SAO, the InterestResidentialStatus field specifies whether the student is interested in Boarding Schools, Day Schools, or Both. In other words, it represents what they are interested in, and not specifically the type of program to which they are applying. **By contrast, the ApplyStatus field specifies whether the student is applying for the boarding or day program. How-To: Process &amp; Manage Files from SAO Integration All of the remaining data is pulled into one PDF on the checklist called the 'SSATB Application PDF'. This PDF is attached to a checklist item and can be downloaded or viewed like any uploaded item. Mapping can be set up so that certain components from the SSATB application flow into different checklist items in Finalsite Enrollment. For example, you can have the recommendation forms from a student's SSATB application flow into and complete their teacher recommendation checklist items in Finalsite Enrollment. This allows for more individualized tracking of an applicant's progress on the checklist. To set up component mapping, navigate to Settings - Fields &amp; Data - SAO Integration. Near the bottom of this page, you'll see an option for SSAT Component Mapping. Click on the Edit Component Mapping button to open the SSATB Component Mapping window. In the SSATB Component Mapping window, you will see a list of application components from the SSATB application that can be mapped to associated checklist items in Finalsite Enrollment. Simply use the drop-down menus provided to find the appropriate associated Finalsite Enrollment checklist item by scrolling through the list. IMPORTANT: Make sure you have selected the correct school year (term) from the picker at the top of the window to see the most up-to-date checklist items. Once you've mapped your desired components, click the green Submit button to save your changes. As the student submits additional documents (such as essays, test scores, etc.), the PDF will update, pulling information from the SSATB system into the PDF as additional pages. The system checks for new documents every night at 4:30 am Central Time. How-To: View the Application Source for Students If you would like to see if an application came through the SAO integration or directly through your Finalsite Enrollment application, you can use the field Application Sources. Applications that come through the SAO integration will have the application source of 'SSATB'. From Search &amp; Reports To search on the application source directly, select the All other fields criteria in search and find the Application Sources field. From there, you can specify which type(s) of applications you want to pull in the search. You can also pull in the Application Sources field as a column on any search. Click on the 'Change Display / Columns' button and you can find this field under ' Contact ' &gt; ' Application ' &gt; ' Application Sources .' Click here to learn more about searches in Finalsite Enrollment. -- From the Contact Record You can also view a student's application source from their contact record by adding this merge field to the contact widget: {{contact.application_sources}} The contact widget is located in 'Settings' - 'Portal' - 'Admin Portal Content' . How-To: Set Up Communications for SAO Applicants If you accept applicants through multiple sources, you can set up an automated communication plan to email your SSATB Applicants once they get into the Finalsite Enrollment system using the criteria below: Trigger: Applicant Additional Criteria: Application Sources - contains - SSATB Perform Action: Send Email At this time: Immediately (or another timeframe as desired) Send to: All parents (or other contacts as desired) You can also use this same setup to set a reminder for someone on your internal team, instead of sending an email. Simply change the value in the ' Perform Action ' box to ' Create Reminder '. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings SSAT Test Score Integration",

    "body": "Overview: The SSAT Test Score Integration provides automatic data importing of student test score data via a direct API. It will store up to the last 3 test scores after your integration has been setup. To Setup the Integration: Please contact Finalsite Enrollment Support For schools who already have the SAO integration, the test scores component can be immediately enabled. For schools who do not accept SAO applications, setup will require contacting SAO / SSAT to obtain three things: the School Code, the API Key, and the API Secret. If you are currently storing SSAT scores in custom fields, there may be a small data migration required to consolidate existing scores into the fields used for the integration. For students who have applied via SAO If the student has previously applied through the SAO (Standard Application Online), the integration will automatically update the student's Finalsite Enrollment contact record with the last 3 SSAT test scores. For students who have applied directly to the school If the student did not apply through the SAO and they take the test separately, Finalsite Enrollment will compare the list of students that released their scores to the school with existing contacts in the system and identify any potential matches. Match &amp; Import To match and import data, go to Settings--Fields &amp; Data--SSAT Matching. This page will display a few key pieces of information on each matched contact such as the first and last name, their status and grade. To view the contact record of the existing contact, click on the blue text along the left that says, \" View Existing Contact .\" Along the right, each match can be verified or removed. If the match is verified , the student\u2019s contact record will be updated with the SSAT scores. No other changes will be made to the student record. If the match is removed , no scores will be brought into the student record and it will disappear from the list. Important Notes: If the student has taken the test multiple times, up to the last 3 sets of scores will be added to the child's record. SSAT data is synced daily",

    "body": "Overview Importing is the process by which you can create or update data in your Finalsite Enrollment system using a .CSV file. This article will cover the process of importing data into Finalsite Enrollment. Please note: The Import Data Tool has a limit of 1000 rows per import file. If you have more rows than this on your import file, please break it up into multiple files before importing. First, you will want to figure out which type of import you want to run, and make sure that you have an appropriate import file configured for it. Data Imports have two options: Create This option will create new contacts in the Finalsite Enrollment system. Create import files can be created by modifying provided import templates. Click here to learn how to prepare your Create import file. Update This option will update existing contacts in the Finalsite Enrollment system. Update import files can be created by using the 'Export as import template' option on a search. Click here to learn how to prepare your Update import file. Once you have your import file ready to go, you can proceed with the steps in this article to actually import the data into Finalsite Enrollment. -- How-To: Import Data To access the Import Data Tool in Finalsite Enrollment, navigate to Settings - Fields &amp; Data - Import Data and click on the green Import Data button. This will open the Validate an Import window. In the Validate Import window, you will fill out the following information. Import Data: Click 'Choose File' to select the saved .CSV file from your computer that you want to import. Import Mode: Choose either 'Create' to create new contacts in the system or 'Update' to update existing contacts in the system. Import Description: Description of what you are importing. Being specific in your description is helpful so that you can easily locate a certain import later on. Dry Run: Check this box to run your import as a dry run test to see if everything will be imported without errors. No data will be created or updated when you perform a dry run. You will need to rerun the import without this option selected to actually create or update the data. Use Mapping Template: If you have a configured Mapping Template that you would like to use for the import, select it from the drop-down menu here. Otherwise, leave it blank. Click here to learn more about Mapping Templates. Run With Duplicate Matching: Check this box when running a Create type import if you would like the system to check for duplicates in the system. You can also reconcile these in Settings - Fields &amp; Data - Duplicate Contact Matching or Duplicate Household Matching . Read the section on Duplicate Matching below for more information. Create Unmatched Parents and Households: This option only appears if you have checked the box to 'run with duplicate matching'. Check this box if you want to create any parents and households that were not able to be matched to existing contacts. Validate Button: Click here to run the import validation. You will receive an email when the import either stops due to errors or is completed successfully. You can wait and refresh the page to see the status, or come back to the page later. If your import failed, click the View button to the right of the import to see the errors and correct them. If the import succeeded, click on View Details to the right of the import to see a list of every contact who was updated or created. -- Import Data Columns Explained Within the Import Data page, you will see the following columns. User: Email address associated with the admin account who ran the import validation. Date / Time: Date and time that the import validation took place. Import Duration: How long it took for the import to run from start to finish. Description: Description of the import, added when you set up the import to run. Import Mode: Whether the import was a Create or an Update type import. See the description of both above. Dry Run: Indicates if the import was run as a dry run (true) or not (false). A dry run import runs through all of the validations to see if there are any errors, but always stops before the data is actually imported. Uploaded File: Link to the original file you imported. This link can be clicked to download the imported file. Transformed File: Link to the transformed file, if you used a Mapping Template. This will be N/A for imports that do not use mapping templates. Click here to learn more. Import Status: Whether the import is pending, successful, or failed. Uses Config: Indicates if a Mapping Template was used for the import. Matching: Indicates if Duplicate Matching was used for the import. This is used for Update-type imports. Create IDs: Indicates if ID Creation ('Create Unmatched Parents and Households' option) was used for the import. View: Displays an import log for the import. Failed imports will list errors found in the import file that need to be resolved. Successful imports will simply list a message of \"No errors. Data was successfully imported!\" View Details: When a file is successfully imported, this option will appear. Clicking on View Details will display a list of all contacts created and updated, with a link to their contact record. -- How-To: Use Duplicate Matching on Imports An import into the Finalsite Enrollment system can be run with automatic duplicate matching. This means that the students, parents, and households in the file will be automatically matched to existing contacts if matches exist. Please read this section carefully before using duplicate matching, as it can have important data implications. Duplicate matching can be performed in two modes. Selecting Run with Duplicate Matching when importing will search the system and use Finalsite Enrollment's duplicate matching technology to find the most likely match. This can be used for any entity type in Finalsite Enrollment (students, parents, and households). If all of the data in the file can be matched: Data will be imported to update the entities specified. This will be done automatically - there is no confirmation of the matches, so this should be done when the data in the file is sufficient to assure a good match. If some of the data in the file cannot be matched: Data import will fail. In both of these cases, a file will be produced showing what data was matched. If the ' Create All Unmatched Contacts and Households ' option is also selected, this allows the system to create any new entities (contacts, households or parents) if no match is found. This option should ONLY be selected when the file has a mix of existing and new entities. The behavior for the ' Create All Unmatched Contacts and Households ' option is slightly different depending on if you are running a Create or an Update type import: If option is selected with a Create import: System will create any students, parents, or households for which it does not find matches. If option is selected with an Update import: System will only create parents or households for whom it does not find matches - any missing student matches will still fail the import. IMPORTANT NOTE: When running an import with duplicate matching, the header row of the import file must be the first row of the file. In addition, for every type of contact (CHILD, PARENT1, etc) that you intend to match, there should not be an ID column as the first column for that entity (ie, CHILD.id. PARENT1.id). The duplicate matcher will assume that any entity with an ID column should not be matched. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Import Standards &amp; Best Practices Import Templates: Creating New Contacts Import Templates: Updating Existing Contacts Data Import Mapping Templates",

    "body": "Finalsite Enrollment integrates with both SKY and ON systems. Additionally, the On Suite/Finalsite Enrollment API works with all modules in the On Suite of products, including OnRecord, OnBoard, Core, and others. What is the setup process like? The initial setup and configuration of this integration will be done by the Finalsite Enrollment Client Services Team. The standard custom data export service level agreement from receipt of final requirements is 6-8 weeks . Once the initial data export is configured, it can be pushed over to Blackbaud by running the export as you would for any custom data export . How does the integration work? The integration pushes data from Finalsite Enrollment to Blackbaud, using a custom export template. When the export is run, a button will appear at the top of the integration screen that says, ' Push To Blackbaud '. The user can also view and download the data that is being pushed, prior to or after pushing the data. Once that button is clicked, the integration will push data to Blackbaud. Once the push is complete, the errors, if any, will be listed at the top of the integration screen. The data will then appear in Blackbaud. About Users The API can both create and update existing users in Blackbaud. The API uses the UserID column to decide whether to perform an update or a create. Users who do not have a UserId in that column will be created. Users who do have that ID will be updated. When users are initially pushed to Blackbaud and created, the Finalsite Enrollment system automatically records their ID in the field called \u2018blackbaud_api_id\u2019. Existing users in Blackbaud must have their IDs imported into that field for the system to correctly update them. Users in Blackbaud can have various roles set by the integration. Student contacts within Finalsite Enrollment can have the role of a Candidate, Incoming Student or a Student. These roles are configured as part of the initial export setup process, based on the school's needs. About Parents and Students Parents will automatically be assigned the role of Parent as part of the export process and linked to their students in Blackbaud. Siblings who are pushed together in a single export will automatically be linked to each other in Blackbaud with the role of Sibling.

This is commonly used for nursery schools or schools with Kindergarten programs to determine eligibility. -- Entry Age Merge Field Token The entry age token(s) are a set of tokens that output different ways of viewing age. These can be embedded into comments on forms, added to the parent portal or admin widget, or put into templates. The entry age token is not a field. That means that it cannot be used to create show/hides on forms, so there is no way to say, 'do not show the rest of the form' or 'change the rest of the form' if a student is or is not a certain age. -- How do I set up the Entry Age Token? To set up this token, go to Settings - General - Basic Setup on your Finalsite Enrollment site and enter the ' School entry date ' for your school. This date must be provided by the school. Choose the month and day from the dropdown menus, then click save at the bottom of the page. The entry age will always calculate from that date. The merge field tokens themselves are as follows: entry_age_year - Outputs as a total number of years (e.g. \"4\") entry_age_year_month - Outputs as a sentence displaying years and months (e.g. \"4 years, 2 months\") entry_age_year_month_day - Outputs as a sentence displaying years, months, and days (e.g. \"4 years, 2 months, 10 days\") entry_age_month - Outputs as a total number of months (e.g. \"40\") entry_age_year_month_decimal - Outputs as a year and decimal for months (e.g. 10 years, 6 months would display as \"10.5\") -- Current Age In addition to entry age, there are several merge tokens you can use to calculate a student's current age. These tokens are dynamic so they will update based on the current date and the student's birthdate as set in Finalsite Enrollment. These include: age_year - Outputs as a total number of years (e.g. \"4\") age_year_month - Outputs as a sentence displaying years and months (e.g. \"4 years, 2 months\") age_year_month_day - Outputs as a sentence displaying years, months, and days (e.g. \"4 years, 2 months, 10 days\") age_month - Outputs as a total number of months (e.g. \"40\") age_year_month_decimal - Outputs as a year and decimal for months (e.g. 10 years, 6 months would display as \"10.5\") Just like the entry age tokens, these current age tokens can be displayed as comments on your online forms, added to the admin and parent portal widgets, and even used on your templates. The age tokens are not fields, so they cannot be used to create show/hides on forms or conditionally show checklist items and fees. A student's current age will always be displayed in years and months next to the Date of Birth in the top section of the contact record (alongside grade, gender, status, and term). In addition, the calculated age will show alongside the birthdate field on the student's contact record and on submitted online forms.",

    "body": "Overview Within Finalsite Enrollment, there are a few different data scrubbing options that can be activated on your site, in order to improve the consistency of how names and addresses appear across the system. Data scrubbing can fix capitalization issues (e.g. names or addresses entered as all caps or all lowercase), standardize address format, and even generate titles for parents. Read on below to understand the different types of data scrubbing options available to you. If you want any of these activated, please contact support and indicate which options you want. Please note: Once activated, the data scrubbing options will take effect on new forms that are imported. Previously submitted data will not be scrubbed by default; however, this additional service can be requested from Finalsite Enrollment Support. Address Scrubbing Address Scrubbing is for household addresses only and doesn't include custom address fields like business addresses or current school addresses, and so on. Finalsite Enrollment provides three different address scrubbing options to provide consistency in how addresses are displayed in your system. When address scrubbing is turned on, addresses are scrubbed upon form import (e.g. when you import a newly submitted application into the system). To have all prior data scrubbed, please request this from support . We will run this service manually so that all addresses meet the format you choose. You have three formats to choose from for address scrubbing: Short Name: e.g. Ct or Ln Full Name: e.g. Court or Lane Abbreviated Name: e.g. Ct. or Ln. The main difference between the short name and the abbreviation is the presence or absence of a period. They are populated according to the US Postal Standards, as shown here . Capitalization Rules Title Case will be used for all major address words and names, except for 'camel case' names such as MacArthur or LaRusso. Additional Information Dashes are automatically added to phone numbers on the admin side, even if the parent doesn't include them when typing in their phone number in a form. Scrubbing for Apartment #20 vs Apt 20 isn't scrubbed for the number symbol. The abbreviation or full name will be set based on the address scrubbing you choose, as mentioned above. Name Scrubbing Finalsite Enrollment also provides name scrubbing for consistent capitalization rules and to allow for consistency with title generation. When name scrubbing and/or title generation is turned on, names are scrubbed and/or titles are generated upon form import (e.g. when you import a newly submitted application into the system). To have all prior data scrubbed, please request this from support . We will run this service manually so that all names meet the format you choose and/or titles are generated for parents. Please note: If you want to correct name data that was scrubbed at any point, you can always edit name subfields within the Personal tab of the contact record . Capitalization Rules Title Case will be used for all names, except for 'camel case' names such as MacArthur or LaRusso. Name scrubbing has the following exceptions: Does not change 2-character first names (e.g. TJ, T.J.) but does change 2-character last names (e.g. Ng). If a preferred name is detected in the first name subfield, it will be placed into the preferred name subfield. Example: If a first name is entered as \"Jeffrey (Jeff)\", the data scrub will make \"Jeffrey\" the first name, and \"Jeff\" the preferred name (also overwriting anything in the preferred name subfield). If a suffix is detected at the end of the last name subfield, it will be placed into the suffix subfield, as long as it matches an existing suffix ignoring capitalization/periods. Example: If a last name is entered as \"Jones, Jr.\" or \"jones jr\", the data scrub will make \"Jones\" the last name, and \"Jr.\" the name suffix (also overwriting anything in the name suffix subfield). Lowercase Articles in Last Names There is an additional option that can be enabled for name scrubbing, based on how you want to handle lowercase articles in last names. When enabled, this option will scrub last names containing articles (e.g. des, de la) so that the articles are lowercase. Example: A last name entered as \"De La Cruz\" would be scrubbed to \"De la Cruz\" (with the lowercase 'la'). If this option is not enabled, articles in last names will remain the way they are entered on the form. Generate Titles for Parents With name scrubbing, you also have the option to auto-generate titles for parents upon form submission. Since the name title subfield cannot be marked as required within a form, title generation is a great way to ensure that all parent contacts in your Finalsite Enrollment site have a title. This option will generate titles for anyone with a parent role assigned (who did not fill out the name title subfield) based on the relationship option selected. If a contact is entered into the form with a relationship of 'Guardian', then a title will not be generated, since gender cannot be assumed. However, for relationship types such as mother, father, aunt, or uncle that have a role of parent, the title will be generated based on the gender of these relationship types.

    "body": "Overview The Legacy Role is used to flag children in admissions or enrollment (except returning enrolled students) that have an alumni parent, a sibling that is currently enrolled at the school, or a sibling that previously attended the school. It can be set automatically or manually, depending on the conditions, as outlined below. NOTE: If your school defines legacy only from a parent-alumni relationship, please contact our Support team so we can build a rule to display this information in the contact widget of the child's record. It's important to know it can be displayed but it will not be searchable. -- How-To: Assign Legacy Role Automatic Assignment of Legacy Role The Legacy flag is set by relationships. Any in-workflow contact that is not a returning enrolled student will have the Legacy Role set automatically under these conditions: A parent for the student has the Alumni role ( is_alumni field set to Yes). Any other related contact for the student has the Alumni role. Most often this will be the sibling, but can also include other relationship types. The student has any relationship to a returning enrolled student. Manual Assignment of the Legacy Role A student can also be manually flagged with the Legacy Role by navigating to their Contact Record and clicking on the green ' Edit ' button - ' Change Role '. In the window that appears, check the box next to Legacy and then click to Save Change. After doing so, they will be marked as a Legacy, as indicated by the text next to their name and grade in the header. Legacy Flag Behavior If a student has a parent who was marked as alumni, and then an admin manually removes the Legacy role for that student, then this value will be held. Example: Child A - Linked to Alumni - Legacy Role manually removed = Not a Legacy Child B - Has Legacy Role - Linked to Alumni = Legacy Additional Examples: If a student does not have the Legacy Role, and they are then linked to a parent who is an Alumni, the Legacy flag will be switched to Yes for the student. If a student is linked to a parent who is an Alumni, they will be given the Legacy Role. However, if the Legacy flag is manually changed to No then the legacy flag will be removed from the student. Legacy Role Set by Additional Relationships The legacy role can also be set from a question on a form for schools that have additional legacy requirements. However, the question should be inclusive of all possible legacy situations, as a student can only have the legacy role set or unset and only one question can be tied to the legacy flag. For example, a question such as, \"Are there any uncles who attended X school?\" would mean students who did not have an uncle who attended the school would mark the question as no, which could remove the legacy flag. However, a question such as \"Are there any relatives who attended X school?\" would set the legacy flag correctly for any legacies and additional questions could then be used to drill down on who the alumni contacts are and any other requested information. Legacy Role Set by Import The Legacy Role can be set by importing a value of 'true' to the is_legacy field. Click here to learn more about importing data in the Finalsite Enrollment system. -- How-To: View Legacy Role on the Contact Record If the legacy role is enabled for a contact, the flag will be displayed under the student name, next to grade and gender. By hovering over the info icon, you can see the relationship, if any, that set the legacy role. Please note: The system takes the first relationship it finds that is relevant to set the legacy role. There is no preference or order in how this is set. If you change a student manually to the legacy role and do not set anything in the parent record, you won\u2019t see who the relationship is from.

All System Admins and Admins with Data permission enabled can access this page. Gender and Pronoun Options The Gender Field Configuration page allows you to enable or disable options for Gender and Pronouns that display on forms and records. For any changes you make on this page to take effect, you must select Submit at the bottom of the page to save your update. Here's a breakdown of each section and what the options mean: Gender Options Select which Gender options you wish to display within forms and records. If enabled, the option will display. If you leave an option unselected, it will not display as a choice in forms and within the record. Current options include: Female, Male, Non-binary, Prefer Not To Answer, and Self-Identify Pronoun Options Show Pronoun Selection: This shows the pronoun field as part of the gender field wherever it's listed on forms and within the student record. Require Pronoun Selection: This makes the selection of a pronoun option required on forms. Pronoun Options can not be altered. Existing options include: she/her, he/him, they/them, and Prefer Not To Answer. Display Pronouns When enabled, this displays the pronoun in the header of the contact record. Relationship Options The Display \"Parent\" Option shows \"Parent\" as an option on all forms. When enabled, \"Parent\" can be selected for the relationship on forms. In other words, any parent within the form can be set with the relationship of \u201cParent.\u201d The Parent option has the same capabilities as the other parental relationships. In other words, they are included on the Parent Portal Access tab under Associated Accounts (which means they can be authenticated and have portal access.) An example of the Parent relationship option in an Inquiry form. Gender and Pronoun Options on Forms Here is an example of what gender and pronoun options could look like on a form. Additional notes: This will vary based on the selections you make within the Gender Field Configuration page. If a student selects Self-Identify for Gender, the text box will allow them to type in their gender. Gender and Pronoun Options on Contact Records On the contact record, the gender is displayed under the student's name. If enabled, the Pronoun selection will also display. Editing You can edit the Gender or Pronoun on a record by selecting the edit fields button on the Personal tab of a record. Gender options in Letters/Emails (Merge Tokens) There are a few gender-based merge fields/tokens to enable personalized communication (in your emails, letters, etc.). These tokens include support for expanded gender options. The available gender-based pronoun tokens are: {{contact.he_she}} - Pulls in he , she , or they depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. {{contact.his_her}} - Pulls in his , her , or their depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. {{contact.him_her}} - Pulls in him , her , or them depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. {{contact.son_daughter}} - Pulls in son , daughter , or child depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. Note: By default, these will output in all lowercase (e.g. she ). However, if you want to capitalize the first letter (e.g. She ), you can use the capitalize filter. To do so, just place a vertical bar/pipe character ( | ) and the word capitalize after the field name but before the closing brackets. For example: #{{contact.he_she | capitalize}} Please note: If no gender is set for a contact, the pronoun tokens will default to they , them , their , and child as well. Search and Filter with Gender Options Search &amp; Reports You can use Gender or Pronouns to narrow the results of a search. In order to add either as criteria, select the Contact Record Everything Else option and then search for the field (Gender or Preferred Pronoun). Use the select option(s) box to pull in the Gender or Pronoun you are searching off of. You can also pull a student's Gender into a search as a column or use it to group data when adjusting the results display. You will find the Gender field nested under the Personal Information grouping. Quick Tip: You'll see the following 2 field options: Gender and Gender (full text). Gender will display a one-letter abbreviation of the students selected Gender. Female = F, Male = M, Non-binary = N, Self-Identify = O, Prefer Not To Answer = P Gender (full text) will display the whole word. Filter Options If you have Gender added as a custom filter option, you can filter based on the Gender selections you've enabled. If you do not have this enabled and would like to add it, please contact our support team .

    "body": "Overview Automated Communication Plans, or ACPs, consist of automated actions that trigger in response to parent or admin actions. They can save time by eliminating routine tasks, as well as automatically provide useful information to families as they progress through the admissions or enrollment process. ACPs are built around certain triggers, which cause different actions to happen in the system. This article will explain how to use these triggers and actions in setting up communication plans in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Important Notes Please note, your field names and values may differ from these examples. Be sure to double-check on the fields setup page in your site by navigating to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields. You may also have custom statuses that you want to use to trigger your ACP steps, instead of the standard statuses described below. Communication plans trigger based on the first time a student enters a status and will not be duplicated if the student moves out of that status and then back into it. For example, if you have a communication plan set up to email students when they become applicants, that same communication plan will not be triggered to be sent again if the student were to move into Application Completed and then moved back to Applicant. Enrollment ACPs: Any Automated Communication Plan that triggers based on the student's status becoming Enrollment in Progress must be set up and activated before rollover in order for the plan to trigger the communication. How-To: Create &amp; Edit ACP Steps Automated communication plans can be accessed by navigating to 'Settings' - 'Communication' - 'Communication Plan' in Finalsite Enrollment. On the setup page, communication plan steps are broken down into three different tabs: Inquiry, Admissions, and Enrollment. Click on any of the tabs to add or edit communication plan steps for that stage of the process. Click on the green Add a New Step button to start creating a new step in your communication plan. To edit existing communication plan steps, click on the blue pencil icon to the right of the step. You can also activate/deactivate plan steps by checking the box in the Active column, or delete steps altogether by clicking the red X button. Adding a new step or editing an existing step will bring up the Edit Plan Step window. This is where you will set up the specifics for each of your communication plan steps. Within the Edit Plan Step window, you can configure the following options: Name Triggers Additional Criteria Actions Date/Time Settings Please note: With the exception of the 'Additional Criteria', all of the options are single-select. This means you cannot, for example, choose a checklist item and a status as your trigger. -- Name Your Plans You can optionally name any communication plan steps to more easily distinguish between them in the list of all plan steps. For example, you might have a step named something like 'New Applicant - Soccer Interest' or 'Transcript Follow-Up Reminder'. These names are only visible to your internal team on the automated communication plan setup page. They will not be visible to parents or students. Names can be changed at any point by using the Edit button (blue pencil icon) next to the communication plan step. If you prefer not to name any step, you can leave this box blank. -- Triggers Select one of the following triggers to cause your action to take place: Checklist Item: Based on a specific checklist item being completed. Status: Based on a contact moving into a specific status. Tip: If you are unable to find the checklist item or status you want, ensure that you are in the appropriate tab. For example, if you are looking for an Inquiry checklist item or Inquiry status, make sure you are in the Inquiry tab within the Communication Plan setup page. -- Additional Criteria (optional) This is where you can get more specific with your communication plan steps and specify any additional criteria (i.e. field values ) that must be met in order for your communication plan to trigger. For example, if a student selected 'Yes' to being an international student or requesting financial aid. Additional Criteria works the same way as the search builder in Finalsite Enrollment, where you select a field, an operator, and a value. Fields are listed in the drop-down menu by their Display Name . You will set the following options: Field: This is a container of data, such as grade or academic interest. Please note that text fields are not available to be used as criteria. Operator: This is the connector or function that denotes a logical operation. These include: is, is not, starts with, ends with, is not blank, is blank. Value: This is the data that is contained within the field. Examples: For the field 'Is International Student', the values could be yes or no. For the field 'Athletic Interest' the values could be soccer, football, tennis, etc. Action: You can click on Remove to delete the additional criteria or Done to save the criteria. You can also add 'AND' / 'OR' statements the same way you would in search. Remember to click the green 'Done' button after setting your additional criteria! -- Actions Select one of the following actions to take place when the trigger/additional criteria is met: Send Email to contacts (e.g. parents) or internal users in your Finalsite Enrollment site. All ACP emails get logged in both the ' Sent Emails ' (or ' Failed Emails ' when applicable) page and within individual contact records under ' Recent Activity '. Create Reminder assigned to an internal user in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Depending on which of these two actions you select for your communication plan step, your additional options will be slightly different. For Sending Emails: You will select who you want to send the email to, such as all parents, primary parents, consultants, etc. You can also send internal emails to members of your team by choosing the 'Finalsite Enrollment User' option ( please note: they must have an Admin Portal Account in the site). This is a multi-select field, so you can pick more than one of the options if you like. You will also select the Email Template that you want to send out. Templates cannot be edited within the Communication Plan setup page, so you will want to make sure that you have made any needed edits beforehand from 'Settings' - 'Communication' - 'Email Templates'. For Creating Reminders: You will select which member of your internal team will get the reminder assigned ( please note: they must have an Admin Portal Account in the site). You will also have a blank text box to input the Reminder Text you want to show for that team member. -- Date/Time Settings For both emails and reminders, you will have a few different options for when you want to send the communication. Under the 'At this time' menu, you can choose from: Immediately: Sends email / creates reminder as soon as a student meets the trigger / additional criteria. N Days After Trigger*: Sends email / creates reminder a specified number of days after the student meets the trigger / additional criteria. You will also set a specific Time that the communication will go out on that day. The maximum number of days supported for this option is 90. On Date*: Sends email / creates reminder on a specific date. You will also set a specific Time that the communication will go out on that day. *PLEASE NOTE: The trigger and any additional criteria must be true at the time that the action (email/reminder) is performed, so keep this in mind when setting up 'N Days After Trigger' or 'On Date' type communication plan steps. Read the below section on Scheduled ACPs for more information. -- How-To: Understand Scheduled ACPs Please take note of the following important details regarding scheduling communication plan steps, and when they will send or not send. The trigger and any additional criteria must be true at the time that the action (email/reminder) is performed. The trigger (checklist item complete or status change) AND all additional criteria (e.g. a certain sports interest, or being an international student) must be true at the same time for the action (email or reminder) to happen. For 'Immediate' Emails/Reminders: If you have an immediate trigger for a student entering a status or completing a checklist item, but the additional criteria field(s) is not set until a few days later, that email/reminder will not go out , as it is already past the time of the scheduled action. For 'N Days After Trigger' or 'On Date' Emails/Reminders: If you have an action scheduled for a future date and a student's trigger or additional criteria field(s) change prior to the scheduled date, this could result in an action being performed or not, depending on if all criteria are now met or not. This behavior helps ensure that the most relevant communications are going out to your applying/enrolling families and your internal team at all times. Consider the following cases: Applicant moves to a new status and the communication plan for the previous status no longer applies. Student data is updated that makes certain communications or information no longer relevant. -- Example of ACP Behavior As an example of the above, imagine that you have a communication plan step that says send an email five days later to all students who become applicants and who answered 'Yes' to a Financial Aid Interest field Scenario A - The above rule is true upon becoming an applicant and indicating an interest in financial aid through a form, and five days later it is still true. Result: email is sent. Scenario B - The above rule is true upon becoming an applicant, but before the five days have elapsed, the Financial Aid Interest field is changed to 'No'. Result: email is not sent. Scenario C - At the time the student became an applicant, there was no indication of Financial Aid Interest so the field was blank. However, prior to the five days elapsing, an admin updated the Financial Aid Interest for the student to 'Yes'. Result: email is sent. Scenario D - Although the student still has the Financial Aid Interest field set to 'Yes', prior to the five days elapsing they are moved out of the Applicant status into a different status. Result: email is not sent.

    "body": "Overview A communication plan is a strategic plan for communicating with families in a targeted and personalized way. Automated communication plans (ACPs) in Finalsite Enrollment are used to help personalize the admissions or enrollment process and save you time by automating common tasks. Make sure you review the related content below to learn how to set up ACPs and incorporate examples for both Admissions and Enrollment. How-To/Tutorial: Automated Communication Plan Setup Example ACPs you can use on your Finalsite Enrollment site: Inquiry &amp; Admissions Automated Communication Plans Enrollment Automated Communication Plans Important Notes Please note, your field names and values may differ from these examples.

Enrollment ACPs: Any Automated Communication Plan that triggers based on the student's status becoming Enrollment in Progress must be set up and activated before rollover in order for the plan to trigger the communication. How-To: Identify Key Communication Messages When crafting your communication plan, you want to think about what are the most important messages or the key points that you want to communicate to families. Informational Messages Informational messages help people through the process and answer common questions. Informational messages remove obstacles within the inquiry, admissions, and enrollment process. Examples of informational messages: Answer procedural questions Give checklist status updates Address concerns (e.g. affordability) Remind families of deadlines -- Interest-Based Messages Interest-based messages connect families with your school's story and are unique to your school. Examples of interest-based messages: Small class size Scholarship opportunities Theater or arts program Academic focus (e.g. STEM/STEAM) Renowned athletic program Interest-based messages center around what attracts families to your school. Communicating your school's story helps you stand out and leads to higher conversion rates at every step of the funnel - particularly in applicant-to-enrolled ratios and yield. Interest-based messages improve mission fit and increase re-enrollment retention. Best practices for interest-based messages with a multi-select field: Scenario: Let's say you have a multi-select field for athletic interests and you want to set up some automated communications that target each of these interests. You don't want families to receive three separate emails if they said their student is interested in three different sports such as basketball, football, and soccer. However, if you have ACPs set up with additional criteria that are specific to each athletic interest, this is what will happen - the family will receive an individual email for each of those three interests. Best Practice: The best way to handle this scenario is to work with Support to create one email template for all athletic interests, that is dynamic according to the sport. The email could show/hide different content based on the interests that are selected. The result is that the family is only receiving one email communication, but it's still personalized to target that student's interests. How-To: Identify the Target Audience The key to personalized communications is deciding who each message is relevant. Even common informational messages should contain personalization. Map Out Touchpoints A touchpoint is a single step in the communication plan. For each touchpoint, you will want to define: What will we say? When* will we say it? Who will say it? How will we say it? (email, phone call, letter, or text) It is possible to schedule a specific date and time that you would like an email or reminder to go out. The default time is 8 AM in your school's timezone; however, you may want to consider choosing a different time when the recipient will be more likely to view it. -- How-To: Get Started on Your School's Communication Plan Start with the basics Pick 2-3 most important informational and interest-based messages. A couple of touchpoints per message. Start with broad categories (e.g. sports vs. soccer or tennis). Build gradually over time. Talk with your families Ask them about the process and where they had questions so that you can address those questions more proactively in the future using your communication plan. Brainstorm as a team Team collaboration creates a better result and increases buy-in. Provides a consistent message to families.

    "body": "Overview Within the Search &amp; Reports tab, you can select different layouts for your reports to visualize your data in a variety of ways, such as a search grouped on a specific field or a summary report. In this article Change Display/ Columns Add and/or rearrange columns in a search Types of searches List List with Groupings Summary Report Graph Change Display/ Columns After you've entered your search criteria and hit Search, you will be able to click the Change Display/Columns button in the upper right of the page. This will open the Results Display window. Within the Results Display window, there are four different results displays : List , List with Groupings , Summary Report , and Graph . You can also add additional fields to display as columns in the report. Click the blue Apply button to submit your changes. Add and/or rearrange columns in a search Use the Change/Display Columns button to pull in additional columns to List or List with Groupings searches. Within the pop-up, the List display option is automatically selected since this is the default view. If you are creating a List with Groupings search, start by selecting that option in the section that says \" Display results in a... \" Fields to Display is where you can select additional fields to pull into the search. (They will display as columns within the search.) You can search for a field by typing the field name into the search bar, or you can manually scroll and open the different groups of fields to see a list of every field within a specific group Search Bar Here, you can type in the name of the field you are looking for. When you begin typing, you will see the options in the Grouping and Field sections update based on what you are entering. Once you search for a field, check the checkbox in the Fields section to pull it into the Selected Fields section. This will allow it to be displayed as a column in your search. You can then drag and drop the field within the Selected Fields section to change the order it appears within your search. Dragging it toward the top of the list moves it to the left within the displayed results of your search. Good to know: In student-based searches, the name of the student will always be the first column within your search even if you drag a field all the way to the top of the list within the Selected Fields section. If you need a refresher on how to find field names, check out this article: How to Find Fields Entity options Your options can also be narrowed by specifying an Entity . Entity options are essentially a way for the system to know who the information belongs to. Change the Entity dropdown to see the list of fields related to students, parents, or households. This can be helpful if you are not sure exactly what field to search for but would like to see a list of fields related to a group. For example, if you wanted to see all fields with information about a student's primary parent, you would select Parent 1 and you could browse through related fields and select the ones you need. Contact: Information related to the student. Parent 1: Information related to the student's primary parent residing in the primary household (household 1.) Parent 2: Information related to the student's second parent residing in the primary household (household 1.) Parent 3: Information related to a parent residing in the student's second household (household 2.) Parent 4: Information related to a parent residing in the student's second household (household 2.) Household 1: Information related to the student's primary address. Household 2: Information relating to the student's second household address. Grouping Grouping is the section that the field is grouped under within the Fields page. For example, information like name and date of birth are typically found grouped under the Personal grouping. When you select a group, all fields within that group appear automatically in the fields section. You can scroll through them and select them individually or use Select All at the top to select all fields within your selected group. Fields This section is where your searched-for fields appear whether you narrow them down by using the search function or opening different groups or entities. The Select All option at the top, selects every field currently listed within the Fields section. You can also select and deselect fields in that section individually. Deselecting a field removes it from the Selected Fields section (and therefore removes it from the search columns.) Selected Fields When you select one of the fields, it will appear in a list under the Selected Fields section on the right. Drag and drop the field to move its position within the search. Dragging the field to the top of the list moves it to the left within the search display. Click the X next to any of the fields you pulled in to remove it. Once you click Apply , your selected field(s) are added to your search as a new column(s). For some fields, clicking the column header within the search allows you to order the search based on the data in that column. Good to know: Rearranging Columns The only column that can\u2019t be moved is the contact (student) name column. All other columns can be rearranged by opening the change/display window and dragging the column to the order that you want it to appear in. Dragging a column to the top of the list will move it to the left. You can only change their order in the change/display window, you can\u2019t move them by dragging them in the search itself. The ability to relocate the column is segmented by contact type. For example, if you pull Parent 1 information into the search, you\u2019ll be able to sort the columns related to Parent 1 separately from the columns related to the student. Types of Searches List The List results display is the default view of your search results. It displays your results in a list format with the contact name appearing in the first column. In addition to the name, you'll see a few other standard columns that automatically appear when you run a search (they depend on what criteria you search by). List with Groupings The List with Groupings results display allows you to group the list of contacts in your search by the options of a single field. Some examples include grouping by Grade, Athletic Interests, Current School, or Contract State. Please note: Some field types, such as text fields, cannot be used for grouping. When you use this option, The field options will display as headers with the associated contacts listed below them, and a total count of contacts per field option will display in the header. In the example below, the List with Groupings option was used to group the students by grade. Grouping a search After opening the Change Display/Columns pop-up window, select the List with Groupings option. In the Group by dropdown menu, select the field that you'd like to group the search by. You can also add additional fields to the search and reorder the columns when you use the List with Groupings options. See the Adding columns to a search section to learn how. Summary Report The Summary Report results display shows a total count of contacts meeting one or two criteria (fields). It provides individual counts for each field's options as well as total counts of each field's options across rows and columns. A row heading is required on the summary report, but adding a column heading is optional. Please note: This is a numerical report and does not display contact names. Below you can see a report when one field is selected and when two fields are selected. Example using one field (row heading only): In the Results Display pop-up, only the Row Headings option is used. Here's what that looks like in the search: There's an individual count displayed for each enrollment type option along the right of each row and a total count for all contacts with either enrollment type included at the bottom in the total row. Example using two fields (row heading and column heading): In the Results Display pop-up, a selection is made for both the Row Headings and Column headings. Here's what that looks like in a search: There's an individual count displayed for each contract state and grade and a total count for all contacts with that contract state along the far right. In addition, there are total amounts calculated for each grade and a combination of these totals near the end of the total column. Graph The Graph results display will show you the number of contacts for each option of the field you select. This provides a visual representation of your data, as well as calculated percentage values. This is a numerical report and does not display contact names. Please note: If there is a long list of options for the field, such as a long current/previous school list, it may not display properly. It is better to use a summary report or list with grouping results display for fields with longer option lists. Here's what a graph display looks like in the search.

    "body": "Overview We all want our emails to look great, however, there are some challenges when sending HTML emails because email clients do not support HTML in the same way and never don't support the full range of HTML styles. So while you have full access to HTML formatting in Finalsite Enrollment, not all email clients will render it the same. Research by leading marketing companies, like Hubspot, have also found that highly formatted emails with lots of HTML, color, and images reduce engagement by 25% on average and click through rates of 51%. For more information, visit this blog post by Hubspot . -- HTML Email rendering issues in Microsoft Outlook Templates are designed to look great across all email clients. However, versions of Outlook from Outlook 2007 to present use Microsoft Word to render HTML email, which can cause problems with email display. Microsoft Word is meant for documents and its attempts to render HTML rarely match web design standards. Some common issues with rendering in Microsoft Outlook: -- Image isn't the right size. Outlook doesn't recognize the HTML that constrains images. This means that if you use HTML to resize an image uploaded to a campaign or template, it may display at the original size in Outlook. Be sure to resize your images before you upload them. -- Image alignment is being ignored Outlook doesn't recognize image alignment. You can work around this by adding a table and then inserting the image in the cell that is aligned to the left or right. -- Image padding is off Outlook will ignore set padding and margins around images. As a result, your wrapped text will be pushed against the image. To fix this, you may have to add padding within the image itself. -- Excess white space Because Outlook renders HTML using Microsoft Word, white space is sometimes inserted above an image. This occurs because Outlook renders email on a computer screen similarly to how print preview shows how the email will look on a printed page. If the image falls between what Outlook sees as two separate pages for that particular section, extra space is inserted above the image to force the image down to the next page. While email is a single, continuously scrolling page, Outlook renders portions of the email as though they are meant to be printed onto separate sheets of paper. Eliminating the extra white space requires reorganizing your content. When reorganizing your content, you ultimately want to determine where Outlook is marking the page break in your content. If there is an image below the white space, try to move the image to another area in your layout and send a test email to see if this fixed the issue. Continue reorganizing and testing your campaign until the white space is eliminated. Email content v. Web HTML The viewing technology of a typical email client isn\u2019t the same as in most web-browsers. Web browsers display interactive and dynamic content. But interactive elements like Flash, JavaScript, or HTML forms won\u2019t work in most email inboxes. Most email clients restrict HTML viewing to basic layout elements even when they are accessed via a web-browser (like Gmail or other services). Safe to use Widely supported by most email clients \u2022 static, table-based layouts \u2022 HTML tables and nested tables \u2022 template width of 600px \u2022 simple, inline CSS \u2022 web-safe fonts Use with caution Limited support from most email clients \u2022 background images \u2022 custom web fonts \u2022 wide layouts \u2022 image maps \u2022 embedded CSS Do not use Not supported by most email clients \u2022 JavaScript \u2022 Flash \u2022 embedded audio \u2022 embedded video \u2022 forms &lt;div&gt; layering -- Use with Caution Web Fonts Our Email Editor allows you to use standard fonts and a select number of custom web fonts. If an email client doesn\u2019t support a web font used in your campaign, the email client will fall back to its default font. Wide Templates Your subscribers often open campaigns on mobile devices or in the preview pane of desktop email clients. Email viewing panes are narrow, so they\u2019ll cut off your message if it\u2019s wider than 600-800px. Finalsite Enrollment automatically limits all emails to 600px wide. Do Not Use The elements below are blocked by nearly all major email clients. Support is either extremely limited, or nonexistent. JavaScript JavaScript is a programming language that makes web content interactive. It\u2019s common in websites, but the vast majority of email clients block scripts since they can hide malicious content. Avoid all JavaScript. Iframe Elements An &lt;iframe&gt; (inline frame) is an HTML element that embeds content from one website into another. Inline frames are often used to insert advertisements, video, audio, or forms in other websites. Iframes often contain scripts, so most email clients block them. Instead, link to the content you want to display in your campaign. Flash Flash displays animations and graphics on websites, but email clients will block it. Adobe has announced the end-of-life of Flash support so all Flash content on your websites should be migrated to open standards such as HTML5. Instead, try gifs to make your content more engaging. -- HTML Forms Text fields, text inputs, radio buttons, and checkboxes are simple HTML form elements, but the submit button often requires Javascript. Some email clients will display forms, but unfortunately, subscribers won\u2019t be able to submit them. Avoid HTML forms, and consider an alternative such as a link to a 3rd party solution like Survey Monkey. -- Embedded media Autoplay and click-to-play media won\u2019t play in an inbox unless your subscriber\u2019s email client supports HTML5 &lt;video&gt; and &lt;audio&gt; tags. Only one major email client, Apple Mail, supports these tags, so it\u2019s best to avoid embedded media and consider an alternative. Instead, insert a text link to your video or audio.",

    "body": "Overview Custom Appointment Forms are a special type of online form within Finalsite Enrollment that can be linked to your calendars. They are useful if you want to collect additional information from a family at the point of event registration. When a family registers for an event (via a public calendar link or a calendar checklist item) with a custom appointment form attached, they will be prompted to enter the information you have set as required on the form. You can create multiple custom appointment forms to correspond to different calendars, or, alternatively, you can link the same custom appointment form to multiple calendars. Please Note: Custom appointment forms will not display for calendars that are embedded in forms (such as the Inquiry form). Parents who are booking themselves for appointments via a form will only enter the basic contact information for the appointment. In this article Custom Appointment Forms + Public Links Note How-To: Create and Edit Custom Appointment Forms How-To: Link Appointment Forms to Calendars Custom Appointment Forms + Public Links Note Public Links Some of your Custom Appointment Forms may be attached to calendars with Public Links. Public Links are links that you use to add the Calendar to a website or email. Whenever a parent or guardian signs up for a Calendar through a public link, a new inquiry is created for the associated student within the system. Because Public Links create a new inquiry each time a sign-up is submitted through them, we recommend only using them on Calendars for students who are not yet in the Admissions/Enrollment workflow (i.e. only use public link calendar sign-ups for your Inquiries and Prospects). You can read more about these in our Public Calendar Links article. Workflow Recommendation for students who've already applied For students in the Admissions/Enrollment workflow, we recommend the following option: Checklist Items Create Calendar Checklist Items for any event that you are sharing with students who are in the Admissions/Enrollment workflow. Have the student/family sign up for the event through the checklist. When signing up through the checklist, the student will be presented with the Custom Appointment form, if you are using one with the event. How-To: Create and Edit Custom Appointment Forms To access Custom Appointment Forms, navigate to Settings &gt; Forms &gt; Custom Appointment Forms in your Finalsite Enrollment site. To create a new custom appointment form, click the green plus sign labeled ' Add Form ' in the top left of the ' Custom Appointment Forms ' page, then enter a display name and canonical name for the form. You can edit custom appointment forms to the same extent -- and using the same process -- as you can with other custom online forms in Finalsite Enrollment. You can read our how-to article on this, here . The content of the custom appointment form is up to you. However, please note that the following fields must be on ALL custom appointment forms and marked as required: Student Name Student Apply Year Student Apply Grade Parent1 Name Parent1 Email Parent1 Phone Please note: Because custom appointment forms are accessed when someone is already booking an appointment, it is not necessary to add an appointment field to an appointment form -- and doing so will actually cause errors on form import. How-To: Link Appointment Forms to Calendars To link a custom appointment form to a calendar, navigate to the calendar in the ' Scheduling ' tab - ' Calendars ' sub-tab. Once you have it pulled up, click on ' Calendar Settings ' in the upper right and then select ' Edit Settings '. In the ' Calendar Details ' details window, there will be a box near the top labeled ' Appointment Form .' Click into this box to select your form, and then hit ' Submit ' to save the change. Once this is done, you can repeat these steps to the next calendar (if applicable). Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Creating New Calendars How to Edit Forms",

    "body": "Overview You can allow parents to book themselves for appointments on your Finalsite Enrollment calendars directly through their student's checklist in the Parent Portal. This can be configured on a per-calendar basis. This article will discuss how to set this up and what it is like from the parent perspective. Allow Parents to Book Appointments To allow parents to book appointments through the checklist in the Parent Portal, you must first enable this setting from the Calendar Settings. First, click on the Scheduling tab and select the calendar you want to make available. Then, click on the green 'Calendar Settings' button in the top right corner and select 'Edit Settings'. In the modal window that appears, under the Calendar Access section, check the box for 'Allow parents to book appointments via the checklist in the Parent Portal'. If you want to also allow parents to cancel or reschedule booked appointments themselves, you can check the 'Allow parents to cancel and reschedule booked appointments in the Parent Portal' box too. Remember to hit Submit to save your changes! Once you have enabled the setting, you will also want to make sure that you have a parent-facing (i.e. required or optional) checklist item for the calendar so that parents can book their appointment. Click here to learn how to set up checklist items. Parents scheduling an appointment Parents can select from any available time slots by clicking the Schedule Appointment button on the student's checklist in the Parent Portal. The calendar will open to a full-month view for the current month. Schools have full control over the number of available slots, how far in advance they can be booked, and when to send reminders and notifications. Parents managing existing appointments If the setting was enabled for the calendar, parents can reschedule or cancel existing appointments through the Parent Portal as well. Duplicate Appointment Bookings If a parent books a duplicate appointment for the event, both appointments will be displayed on their checklist. (They'll display on your end in the Admin-facing checklist as well.) If you've allowed parents to cancel/reschedule appointments in the parent-facing checklist, they'll have the option to cancel/reschedule any of the appointments. In other words, if a parent has signed up for an event three times, they'll have the cancel/re-schedule option for all three bookings.

    "body": "Overview When the Blackbaud integration is set up, data is synchronized nightly by pulling it from Blackbaud into Finalsite Enrollment. The goal of this process is to keep the two database systems in sync regarding demographic data so that schools can avoid having to dual maintain vital contact information between the two systems. This integration is meant to be used in addition to the regular Blackbaud integration, which pushes data from Finalsite Enrollment to Blackbaud. The two-way sync is optional and can be enabled for any Pro customers currently using the Blackbaud integration (ON Suite or SKY). How-To: Set Up Two-Way Data Sync &amp; Notifications To use the two-way data sync process, it must first be enabled by Finalsite Enrollment - please contact our Support Team for assistance. Once the sync is enabled, a new user notification will become available to all admins of the school with Data permissions . This notification will include the results of the data sync, every time the sync process is run, in the Daily Summary email. To enable this user notification, click on your name in the upper right of Finalsite Enrollment, then select ' User Notifications '. Under the Data subheading, you will see an option for 'Results from the Blackbaud Sync process. (Daily Summary)'. Check the box to enable this notification - no save is necessary. Please Note In order for the Two-Way sync process to work, students need to be pushed a first time to initiate the syncing process. Once you've completed your first export/push, the two-way sync will be able to transfer data as described below. How-To: Understand the Two-Way Data Sync Process Once enabled, the sync process runs every night, at approximately 3:30 AM Central Time. It will pull a list of all contacts updated in Blackbaud since the last time the sync process was run, then it will compare that list to those same contacts within Finalsite Enrollment. If a contact was updated within the same time period within both systems and has different data, the sync process will flag this as a conflict. The notification email will list all conflicts, which must be resolved manually. This is to prevent a situation in which a piece of data was simultaneously updated in both systems. If a contact was updated in Blackbaud with different information than what is currently in Finalsite Enrollment and there is no conflict, the sync will overwrite the data in Finalsite Enrollment with the data from Blackbaud. The notification email will list all overwritten data. At this time, the process will sync the following pieces of information: Address_1 Address_2 City State Zip Country Phone_1_number* Phone_2_number* Phone_3_number* Email *Keep in mind that phone numbers will be written back from Blackbaud in the order of home, cell, and work. So, home will write into phone_1, cell into phone_2, and work into phone_3. Frequently Asked Questions Can we push Emergency Contacts? No, unless your school has reserved some of your Blackbaud custom fields for this. Please note, the integration allows for up to 10 custom fields. A student was pushed in the first batch and their sibling was pushed in the second batch. Why are they not listed as siblings in Blackbaud? Siblings need to be pushed together to be linked in Blackbaud. You will need to re-push the siblings to link them in Blackbaud. Relationship linking \u2013 what relationships are pushed? All parents are currently pushed with a relationship of \u2018parent\u2019. Siblings are only linked if they are all pushed together. Roles include: Candidate Incoming Student Student Each role requires specific fields to be pushed to correctly place a student into that role within Blackbaud. The OnBoard standard export should be used for Candidates and the OnRecord standard export should be used for Incoming Student/Students. Our school has both admissions and enrollment in Finalsite Enrollment and would like to know if we should push into OnBoard or OnRecord. It depends on your process. If you need to adjust Candidates (Applicants) within Blackbaud before rolling them over in that system, you should push into OnBoard. If your entire process from admissions to enrollment is done within Finalsite Enrollment, you should push into OnRecord once students have enrolled.

    "body": "Overview Reminders are a great way for you to manage any next steps for each individual student or family. They are set within the contact record for a student; however, they can all be managed within the Dashboard, along the right of the funnel. This article will explain how to view and manage reminders from the dashboard. Click here to learn more about setting up reminders within a contact record. -- How-To: Use the Dashboard Reminders Workflow The Dashboard is the first page you end up on upon logging into your Finalsite Enrollment site. You can also navigate to it at any time by selecting the word Dashboard to the left of your modules towards the top left of the screen. Once you are on the Dashboard, you will see the Reminders section to the right of the page. In the Reminders section, you have access to the following options and information. Viewing Reminders For The reminder view will always default to your reminders; however, if you click on your name next to the 'Viewing reminders for' text, you can select another user from the drop-down menu to view their reminders. Groupings &amp; Due Date Reminders are ordered by their Due Date. You will see the exact due date at the right of each reminder. They will also be grouped into categories of Overdue, Today, Next 7 Days, and Later (7 Days) depending on when they are due. To change the Due Date for a reminder, simply click on the listed date. Reminder Owner Each reminder will display the name of the owner in blue text above the reminder text. If you need to reassign a reminder to another Finalsite Enrollment user, you can click on the owner name and select a new one from the drop-down menu. It will then show up on the new owner's reminder list and be removed from the list you are currently viewing. Reminder Text If you need to edit the text of the reminder, hover over the reminder and the Edit button (pencil icon) will appear in the top right corner of the reminder. Click on it to make your desired changes to the reminder text, then click on the green Save button (also in the top right corner of the reminder) to confirm. Contact Name The name of the associated contact will appear at the bottom of the reminder. You can click on this name to go directly to the contact record. Complete Reminder Click the checkmark to the left of any reminder to mark it as complete. This will make it disappear from the dashboard Reminders view and from the associated contact record. Once a reminder is completed, it cannot be retrieved or viewed, as reminders do not have a history stored in the system. Delete Reminder If you want to delete a reminder instead of marking it as complete, hover over it and the Delete button (red X) will appear in the top right corner of the reminder. Click on it and you will be asked to confirm that you want to delete the reminder. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Reminders, Recent Activity, &amp; Document History Contact Record: Summary Tab User Notifications",

Types: System Admin and Admins Permissions: Any The following items can be edited by admins: Creating new forms and pages Adding a section (field, heading, comment box) Changing the Map-To value Deleting a section Changing page name Changing text for prompts, headers/subheaders, or comments Rearranging order of form fields Adding, editing, or removing Show/Hide Dependencies Filtering option lists Linking or unlinking associated calendars Field options, required fields, read-only fields, hidden fields, default values for fields Editing field options within the Fields page Creating new fields within the Fields page How-To: Create a New Online Form To get started with creating a new online form, go to Settings &gt; Forms and select the type of form you would like to create. Once you are on the page, click the green (+) Add Form button near the top of the page. The Custom Form details window will appear. Here, you can enter the Name and Canonical Name for your new online form: Name: The display name that appears at the top of the online form when it is being filled out. This can be updated at any time by clicking into the form. Canonical Name: The internal name used on the backend of the system to identify the form. A best practice for the canonical name to replicate the display name of your form in all lowercase letters and with underscores in place of spaces (e.g. parent_interview_notes). Avoid ending it in an underscore. Please note: The canonical name cannot be changed once the form is created. Click the blue Submit button to proceed with creating the new form. The page will refresh and a message will appear at the top of the screen notifying you that the custom form was successfully created. How To: Add a New Page To begin adding pages and content to your new online form, click on the form name in the list of forms on the page. On the form details page, you should see the following information: Display name of the form. This can be edited by typing into the box, then clicking the grey 'Save' button. Canonical name of the form. This will be read-only, since it cannot be edited. Back to custom forms link in the upper right. This will take you back to the previous page with the list of all forms of that type. A draft version of the form with a list of actions (i.e. show, clone, publish, delete). A form comment box . This is useful for tracking changes made as you publish new versions of the form. Type into the box and click the blue 'Save' button. To add the first page to your newly created form, click the Show link within the Actions column, then click the green (+) Add Page button next to the form name. Within the Add Page window, you can input a name for this page. If the form only has one page, you may use the form name as the page name. For forms that have multiple pages, a best practice is to use different names for each page based on the content (e.g. Applicant Information, Household Information, etc.). Click the blue Submit button to save the page you just created. Page names will always display at the top of the page in the format of a header. Now that your form and its first page have been created, the next step is to add content! For the page you just created, click on the Edit link within the Actions column along the right. Once the page opens, you can click on Add Field to add content, such as fields, comments (text), and headers/sub-headers. To learn about the different types of form fields and their options, click here . Continue adding as many pages and fields as needed. Remember to click the blue Save button at the bottom of the page after making any edits. When you're ready, you can Publish the form from the main form page. Once you have published a form, you can add it to the checklist for students or your internal team. How-To: Connect Forms to Checklist Items To interact with an online form as a parent or an admin/user, you will need to tie the form to your Admissions or Enrollment Checklist as an online form-type checklist item. Click here to learn how! Once the form is tied to the checklist, you can also set who can fill out the form (parents only, admins only, or parents and admins).

    "body": "Overview Online Forms in Finalsite Enrollment allow you to easily collect information from your applying/enrolling families or internal notes from your team - no paper needed! In this article, you can learn about the different types of online forms that exist in Finalsite Enrollment, and the different states for creating, editing, and publishing them. Who has access to add and edit forms? Types: System Admin and Admins Permissions: Any How-To: Understand Different Form Types All online forms can be found within Settings &gt; Forms. Admissions Forms aren't term-based, however, Contract Forms and Custom Enrollment Forms are. You can use the terms picker at the top of the page to select the desired term/school year to view or edit. See below for descriptions of each form type. Please note: Your list of online form types may differ from this depending on which modules you have purchased. Inquiry Forms \u2013 The form a family fills out to inquire about your school. Application Forms \u2013 The form a family fills out to apply to your school. Custom Admission Forms \u2013 Any form other than the application that a family would fill out during the application process. Some examples include student essay questions, a personal statement form, and/or event signup forms. Custom Appointment Forms - Special type of form that can be linked to calendars to collect additional information at the time of event registration. Teacher Recommendation Forms \u2013 Forms parents can send electronically to teachers to receive recommendations. These can be subject-area specific or general. Recommendation Customization \u2013 This page allows you to customize the decline reasons for teacher recommendation forms. Checklist Item Request Forms - Forms parents can send electronically to receive school transcripts, records, or other documents. Commonly known as Document Request Forms. Contract Forms \u2013 The form used after a family accepts an offer to your school and decides to enroll. This typically contains a student's tuition, fees, and payment plan options. Contract Forms are term-based, so make sure you select the desired term you'd like to view/edit from the drop down menu. Custom Enrollment Forms \u2013 Any form other than the enrollment contract/registration form that a family would fill out during the enrollment process. Some examples include emergency contact forms, health forms, and/or transportation forms. Custom Enrollment Forms are term-based, so make sure you select the desired term you'd like to view/edit from the drop down menu. How-To: Understand Different Form States When you click into a specific form within Settings--&gt;Forms , you will see up to 3 different form states/sections as explained below. Form States: Draft (see screenshot above): A non-published, editable version of the form. Drafts are not visible to your applying or enrolling families. To edit, you'll click on the ' edit form ' button for basic text edits. From there, you can access the advanced editor in the upper right of the form. Active (see screenshot above): The current published version of the form. This is the version of the form visible to families, if it's parent-facing and/or to your admins/users on the checklist. Important Note: Only one version of any form can be active at a time. Retired (see screenshot below): This is a previously published version of the form that has been retired in favor of a new version. Retired versions of forms are no longer visible to your applying or enrolling families. A history of all prior versions of your published forms will be maintained. Retired forms will be collapsed by default. Click on the text to expand and display all retired versions of the form. Form Columns State: This includes draft, active, and retired as explained above. Please note, some actions are only available in certain form states. Created At: This is the date and time that the form was created, displayed in your school's local timezone. Published At: For active or retired forms only, this is the date and time the form was published, displayed in your school's local timezone. For Draft forms, this column will be blank, since they have not yet been published. Last Edited By: This displays the name of the Admin or Finalsite EMS employee that last edited the form and saved their changes. Actions: Click on the 'Select' drop down to view or make changes to your form. Important Note: Available actions vary by form state. Actions include: Publish (Make Active): This will publish the form as 'Active' and make it visible to families. This action retires the previously active version of the form. Custom forms must be attached to the checklist in order to be visible in the Parent Portal. Go to Advanced Form Editor: This option will open the advanced form editor, which allows you to make changes to field dependencies, adding/removing questions, etc. Click here to learn more. Delete: This will permanently delete the draft version of the form. This action will not display for active or retired forms. Deleted drafts cannot be recovered. Clone: This action creates a copy of the form in a draft state so you can edit and/or publish it. A best practice is to clone the active form, so that you are editing the most recent version. Export: This action will export the form to .CSV Preview: This action will allow you to preview the form as a family would see it in the Parent Portal. This is the best way to test the changes made to the form. Preview (Admin View): This action will allow you to preview the form including any hidden or internal fields on the form that are not parent-facing. This view may include a waiver code field for example. Form Comment: This is where you can leave a note about the form version. This is useful for tracking changes made as you publish new versions of the form. Type any text into the box and click the 'Save' button to save your comment. Saving Edits Basic Form Editor For each text area that you edit within the Basic Form Editor, you will need to click the ' Save ' button to set your changes. Please note, once you're done making all individual edits, you will not need to save the page as a whole before previewing and publishing. The Basic Form Editor only requires you to save each text area that you update. Advanced Form Editor When working in the Advanced Form Editor, you will need to save the page as a whole via the 'Save' button at the top or bottom of the form, instead of having the option to save each content area you add/remove/update, which is the case in the Basic Form Editor.

    "body": "Overview At various points throughout the year, you may need to make changes to your existing forms. A few common changes are updating form text or key dates, adding fields (questions), and adding/updating field dependencies. The Basic Form Editor allows you to make text changes, which you can learn more about here . The Advanced Form Editor allows you to make additional changes that cannot be made in your Basic Form Editor. These include: Advanced Editor Only: Add Fields Edit/Add Tables Edit/Add Bulleted Lists Set Dependencies/Rules or Filter Options Set Required/Optional/Hidden Fields Change Field Type (ex change a header to a subheader) Edit Likert Field Definitions (the header on recommendation forms) Edit what parts of a field with multiple pieces of information are displayed such as nickname or prefix within the name field. Changes Available in the Basic Form Editor AND Advanced Form Editor: Header and Subheader Text Field Prompts (The questions on your form) Comment Text For more details on edit permissions within the basic form editor vs the advanced form editor, and what changes need to be made by the Support Team, please refer to this article. Who has access to add and edit forms? Types: System Admin and Admins Permissions: Any How-To: Create &amp; Edit a New Draft Online forms can be created or edited by navigating to Settings &gt; Forms and then clicking on the type of form you want to update (e.g. teacher recommendations, contract, etc.). To edit a form, it must be in a draft state. To make a draft of an existing form, navigate to the specific form from the Settings menu, and then follow these steps: Locate the currently active version of the form (the one with active listed under the 'State' column). Click on the Clone button under the 'Actions' column. This will create a draft copy of the form you cloned. How to Get Started Go to Settings &gt; Forms and select the Form you'd like to edit. In this example, we're going to edit the Application Form. Navigate to the ' Active ' version of your form, which is the one that's currently viewable to families if it's a parent-facing form, or that's active internally such as an Interview Notes form. Next, you'll need to clone the active form so that you have a draft version. Within the ' Actions ' column, click on ' Select ' and choose ' Clone .' Please note, the active version will remain active until you publish a new version. This will create a ' Draft ' version of your form. Important note: Drafts are not visible to families - they will always see the active version of any form. Click on the ' Select ' drop down from the ' Actions ' column and select ' Go To Advanced Form Editor . If you prefer, you can also start in the Basic Forms Editor for text edits and then navigate to the Advanced Editor for all remaining changes. Click on the ' Edit Form ' button to open the Basic Form Editor. You can now make text edits with ease. For all remaining edits, click on the ' Go to Advanced Editor ' button in the top right of the form. Page Name and Order Once in the edit mode for any page, you can edit the Page Name at the top of the edit window. This name appears at the top of the page when a family is filling out the form. To edit or re-order other pages of the form, click on ' Return to Page Selection .' You can now see all pages within your form. To learn how to add a new page from the option at the top, click here . The actions you can take include: Edit - Click here to make edits within the Advanced Editor view. Delete - Permanently delete the page. Move Up - Move the page to an earlier position of the form. Move Down - Move the page later in the form. Each page of the form is composed of various sections with different settings and options as explained below. How-To: Add a Section, Field, or Comment Once you are in the Advanced Form Editor, you have two options for adding sections, fields, or comments to the form. Option 1: Add to the Bottom of the Form You can add a section, field, or comment by scrolling to the bottom of your form and clicking on the Add Field button, right above the Save button. This will add the field below everything else on the form (i.e. at the bottom of the form). Option 2: Add to a Specific Area of the Form You can also add a section, field, or comment to a specific area of the form. To do so, locate the existing content above or below where you want the new content to be placed. Then, you can click on the Actions button to the right of the existing content, and choose to Add field above or Add field below , as appropriate. With either option, if you add a section, field, or comment, and then later want to move it to a different area of the form, you can reorder anything on the form with a few clicks. Click and hold your cursor on the grey area of the section to move and drag and drop it to the desired location. How-To: Add Fields, Dependencies and Filters on Forms To learn how to set all of the criteria for a new field (the questions on your forms), how to set dependencies (if \"x\", then \"y\") and filter options list, please refer to the articles below. Form Fields &amp; Options Field Dependencies &amp; Filters on Forms How-To: Save Changes &amp; Publish the Draft After making all of your desired changes to a page, make sure to scroll to the bottom and click on the Save button. This will redirect you to the main form page with all of the pages listed. If you are done making changes, click in the top right to go Back to form history. Back on the form setup page, you can add a Form Comment to your new draft version by typing in the text box to the right of your draft, and then clicking the Save button. Form comments are useful so that your internal team can track what changed which each version of the form. If you are ready to make your edited draft the currently active version of the form, all you will need to do is click on Publish from under the 'Actions' menu. As soon as you click to publish, the form state will change from 'draft' to 'active', while the previously active version of the form will change to 'retired'. This is because you can only have one active version of each form at any given time.

    "body": "Overview Did you know? Did you know that you can create and edit your own fields? Check out this article to learn more: Creating and Editing Fields. Within Finalsite Enrollment, fields are the containers that store specific data about students, parents, or other contacts in the system. Fields can store different values for different contacts (e.g. a child vs. a parent). Some common examples of fields that you might see in your Finalsite Enrollment instance are: Name (student, parent, etc.) Apply Grade or Apply Year Academic or Athletic Interests Test Scores Current School Financial Aid Amount International Student You can access a list of all fields in your system by navigating to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields. This opens the Fields Setup Page as shown below. Here you can: Search for a field by typing the field name in the filter options search bar Edit elements of an existing field (e.g. change groupings, set as searchable) Examine where the field is being used in the system Click here to learn more about these options. In this Article How-To: Use Fields to Collect/Store Data Online Forms Contact Records Bulk Updates How-To: Edit Field Data for a Contact How-To: Understand Field Display Options How Fields are Displayed Internally Hide From Form How Fields are Displayed to Parents How-To: Use Fields to Collect/Store Data Fields live in a few different areas within your Finalsite Enrollment site, so they can be used to collect information and view or edit that information later on. Read on below for more. Online Forms The most common way you will use fields is for collecting information from families on Online Forms throughout the Admissions/Enrollment process. Your major forms include the Inquiry Form, Application Form, and Enrollment Contract. You may also have supplemental forms such as teacher recommendations, health/emergency contact forms, intent to enroll forms, and more. Each piece of data (e.g. current school name, emergency contact phone number, academic interests, etc.) that you want to collect on these forms needs to be its own field. While the form examples listed above are parent-facing, you may also have some internal-facing forms that collect information visible to your school only. An example of this would be a Parent/Student Interview Form, which may contain fields for specific interview responses. Contact Records However, not all fields needed for your process will necessarily be contained within your online forms. You may also have internal-only fields (that are filled out by your team instead of by applying/enrolling families) that you want to fill out directly from a parent or student contact record . Some examples of internal-only fields include: Financial aid or scholarship amounts Waiver codes Interview notes Fields that trigger specific checklist items or contract fees to appear Even if these fields are internal-facing to your school only, they can still be used in your searches and reports, so long as they are marked as searchable within the Fields setup page . Field data can be edited from the contact record by going to the specific tab where the field lives (i.e. personal , admissions , or enrollment ), then clicking on the 'Edit Fields' button. This is described in more detail below in the 'How to Edit Field Data for a Contact' section . Bulk Updates Field data can also be updated in bulk for students from a search/list page, or through a contact import. Click the links below to learn more: Bulk Edits (from list page or search) Import Templates: Updating Existing Contacts (using import data tool) How-To: Edit Field Data for a Contact As mentioned above, fields are most often filled out by parents/students within online forms. Some fields may be entered in by you and your team, if using an internal-facing form or setting values for fields internally within the contact record. Once a form is submitted by a family, they cannot edit any of the fields within that form. However, the fields can be updated internally by your school within the contact record . To do this, navigate to the contact record that requires an update, then click on the appropriate tab where the specific field is grouped. Click on the blue ' Edit Fields ' button in the upper right, update the field value(s), and then click the green ' Save Edits ' button. The new field value will not be updated on the submitted form, but it will be updated throughout the system so that all reports are up-to-date and any additional online forms that are used later in the process will also be updated. How-To: Understand Field Display Options How Fields are Displayed Internally Fields have two internal-facing names. One is the Display Name , which is the name of the field that you see in the contact record, search and reports, list pages, etc. It is the \"friendly\" name of the field and is customizable so that you can easily identify what information is being captured. It does not have to match the canonical name, which is described below. A best practice is to always have a unique display name for each field, as having two fields named exactly the same will become challenging when trying to build searches/reports or locate a field on a contact record. The other internal-facing field name is the Canonical Name . This is the name of the field used on the back-end of the system and it can never be changed. The canonical name is created at the time that the field is created. You will see the canonical name when building forms and in the field settings page. It will always be made up of all lowercase letters and underscores instead of spaces. Hide From Form Hide From Form is an option you can select with creating or editing a field. When Hide From Form is selected for a field, it conceals the value of that field from admins when they view it on a form. For instance, in the image below, both the Gender field and the Applicant's Birth Date field have Hide From Form enabled. Consequently, when an admin views the form, they will not see the data stored in those fields. When \"Hide From Form\" is selected: Parents will still be able to see the data within the field on their end. Regardless of an admin's permission level, whenever they view forms on the record, download the PDF version of the form, or check out the form in the review module, they will encounter 'Hidden From View' instead of the actual data for any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled. This only applies to viewing the field on a form. Any field with 'Hide From Form' enabled will continue to display its data within searches, on the contact record (if the field is visible in the Contact Widget or within tabs like Personal, Admissions, or Enrollment ), in emails, and any other location where the field is displayed. The information is only hidden from admin when the view the field on a form. Good to know: Hide Form Form is reversible. You can de-select ' Hide From Form' in the field settings at any time and, as soon as you do so, the data will start to display again. How Fields are Displayed to Parents Parents/students will see fields only in the version of a prompt on an online form. They will not see field display names or canonical names. The prompt can be a word or two indicating the information needed such as name, address, or current school. It can also be a question such as, \"Did this parent attend Finalsite Enrollment Academy?\" Sometimes the internal display name of a field is also used for the parent-facing prompt, but in many cases, they vary. Let's look at a few examples: Display Name: Birth Date Canonical Name: birth_date Prompt on Form: Date of Birth Display Name: Full Name Canonical Name: name Prompt on Form: Name of Student Display Name: Apply Grade Canonical Name: apply_grade Prompt on Form: Interested in Grade Display Name: Academic Interests Canonical Name: interests_academic Prompt on Form: What academics are most exciting? Display Name: Referral Method Canonical Name: referral_method Prompt on Form: How did you hear about Finalsite Enrollment Academy?

    "body": "Overview Bulk File Upload provides an easy-to-use method to upload scanned files to multiple students at once and is located within Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Bulk File Upload. Process Overview: Bulk file upload is best suited for processing a lot of student files at once. If you are uploading only a handful of student records, it may be faster to go directly to the student record and upload files there. Within the bulk file upload tool, you can upload a single PDF file that contains multiple pages of documents that belong to multiple kids. The system will then analyze the file looking for student names and will then create suggestions for each page within that file. The User will confirm matches or manually select the correct match if a match wasn't found, or if the wrong contact was suggested. Once all matches have been confirmed, submit the file for processing. File Naming When you upload files in Finalsite Enrollment, they will keep their original file names. However, if you need to, you can easily edit and update the file names within the system after they\u2019ve been uploaded. This gives you the flexibility to adjust names for better organization or clarity. Single and Multiple File Upload Behavior Single File Upload Checklist Items: Once a file gets uploaded to a single upload checklist item, that file will be overwritten if a new file is uploaded to that checklist item via bulk file upload or individual file upload. If you'd like to maintain multiple files within a single checklist item, update the checklist item type to multiple file upload within Settings &gt; Checklist Multiple File Upload Checklist Items: For multi-file uploads, each new file that's uploaded to a checklist item either individually or using the bulk file upload tool will be added. If you add a new version of the same document with the same file name to the checklist item, this file will be added as a second file and will not overwrite the existing file. The reason is that each file that's uploaded is assigned a unique file name, with a string of numbers/letters at the end of the file name that cannot be edited. File Version Tracking For those schools that are interested in versioning of files, there's a few ways to handle this: An admin can delete the existing file that's an older version and upload the new one (in which case there wouldn't be any log of the original file being there). Or an admin can leave the old file there and upload the new one.The most recently uploaded file will be listed at the bottom of the file list. Files cannot be assigned custom names, however, the files will display in order from oldest to newest from top to bottom. Step-by-Step Details To get started go to Settings Fields &amp; Data Bulk File Upload. Note -- Only users with the admin role and data permissions enabled will be able to access this feature. Upload your file Click on the green plus sign or text to add a single PDF file to upload. Select the term &amp; checklist item that you want to assign the scanned documents to for each kid. Then drag and drop the PDF file into the designated area or click to select the file from your computer. Bulk File Upload only uploads files to a single checklist item at a time. For example, school transcripts or grade Once you have the term, checklist item and file selected, click the ' submit ' button. The file upload process will take a few minutes to complete. You do not have to wait around for the system to complete this task. You can always return later to the Bulk File Upload page and pick up where you left off. A pending status and a processing pages status will display while the document is being uploaded, as shown below. Once the document gets uploaded, a smart matching message will display, letting you know that possible matches are being determined for all of the documents within the uploaded file. Once the file is uploaded, it will open automatically to start the matching process if you stay on the page. If you left the page to work elsewhere in the system and you return to the Bulk File Upload page, the following details will display: Uploaded (1): The date that the file was uploaded. Uploaded By (2): The name of the Admin that uploaded the file. Checklist Item Name (3): The name of the checklist item that the individual files will be uploaded to in each student's record. Term (4): The term of the checklist that the files will be uploaded to. Status (5): The status of the file.'Awaiting Confirmation' means the file hasn't yet been matched to each contact. 'Finished' indicates that the file was successfully uploaded. Download file (6): This icon allows you to download a copy of the uploaded file. Delete file (7): The red trashcan allows you to delete the file. Confirm Matches (8): Click this button to go through the matching process, which assigns each document within the PDF to individual contact records. Click on the ' confirm matches ' button along the right to go through the matching process. Admin Match Confirmation and Manual Matching Once the file has been processed, the admin can review the document and confirm that each page is tagged with the correct student. The student's name, gender and birthdate will appear in the match list at the bottom of the page. If the match is correct, the admin click on the next button in the bottom right. If the page needs to be re-oriented because it was uploaded upside down or on its side, you can use the rotate arrows above the document. Once you rotate the document, it will save the new orientation for the checklist. When no match is found, the admin can manually tag pages with students. Click on the name menu at the bottom of the page and select the student name from the dropdown menu to assign it. Then click ' next Note: The system only suggests matches to students for whom the checklist item selected is valid. For example, if you select 2017-2018 school year and the Transcript Upload checklist item, only students in that term will be available to be tagged. Once all pages have been reviewed, the admin will be presented with a summary page prior to final confirmation and upload. Here you can see the page number and who it was matched to. Click on the student name to access their student record. Each match can be edited by clicking on the ' edit match ' button along the right. For any pages that weren't matched because the name on the document didn't align with any kids in that term, a warning message in yellow will be displayed at the bottom. Unmatched documents will be discarded as there's no kid's checklist to assign them to. Once all matches are confirmed, click on the ' submit matches ' button at the bottom of the page. All files will be uploaded to the chosen checklist item for each individual contact matched. You can navigate away from the page while you wait. You can also download the original document by clicking on this button at the top of the page. File Processing Once the admin has reviewed and submitted the file for upload, the file will be split into subfiles and uploaded to the student record. The results page will display the students that each page was assigned to. There's a status message that displays at the bottom of the page indicating that the files have been processed and attached to the selected contact To view the attached files, you can click on each student's name in the results page. Within the transcript upload checklist item, we'll see the following behaviors: The system will take the single large file and break it up into sub-files for each student. If there are multiple pages tagged to the same student, those will be turned into a single file and attached to the student's checklist item. The attached file will also be available in the Form &amp; Document Submission History section of the student record. The system will automatically check off the checklist item and date it once the file has been uploaded to that student's checklist item. Pages that were not matched to a student in the term selected will not be uploaded About the Auto-Matching Process The Finalsite Enrollment system will analyze the file you uploaded to determine potential matches. This is done via a combination of OCR (optical character recognition) and fuzzy matching. OCR processing works best with scanned documents that contain a good level of contrast between the text and the background. Documents with textured backgrounds, such as birth certificates, can be difficult to extract matches from. Angled text can also present issues so it is important that documents scanned are reasonably vertical on the page. Interestingly, documents that are scanned upside down are easier to read than if the document is scanned at a 20-degree angle. When the file scanned contains lower quality results, there is a tendency for the system to find errant matches, particularly, finding matches with students who have shorter names since the match system is working with a less complete n-gram set. Other issues may arise when the parent name visible on the document may share a similar name with a student or other text that has name-like properties, for example, school names or street address Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings How to merge multiple files into a single PDF Adobe Acrobat Apple MacOS",

    "body": "Overview A key part of the enrollment module in Finalsite Enrollment is the ability to list a student's tuition, as well as any tuition discounts, on their electronic contract. For schools on our PRO plan, specific tuition and tuition discount amounts can be set up in the system and applied to student contracts based on contract fee rules . In this article, you can learn more about tuition, tuition override, and tuition discounts in Finalsite Enrollment. Base Tuition Amount All contracts require a single active tuition fee when generated. If there is no tuition applied or there are multiple tuitions applied, a contract generation error will appear. Contract fee rules are used to determine which tuition applies to a given contract. The base tuition is a flat amount that can be modified through financial aid, scholarships, tuition discounts, and required fees to create a final amount. Examples: Lower School Tuition Upper School Tuition Day Tuition Boarding Tuition International Tuition Default Tuition Tuition Override Tuition can be set manually by entering a value in the Tuition Override (tuition_override) field on a student\u2019s contact record or via import . The tuition override works independently of the other line items which still apply based on the fee rules defined. The amount entered into the tuition override field will become the new tuition amount for the student. For example, if you wanted the student's tuition amount to be $5,000, you would enter '5000' as the value in the tuition override field. Even if you plan to use tuition override, students still need to have a default tuition amount applied through contract fee rules in order for the contract to generate successfully. Tuition Discounts Tuition discounts are not required to be on a contract but are useful for assigning a discount to a specific type of student, as indicated by a contract fee rule . For example, you might give a discount to students with a parent/guardian who works for your school, or to students who are in a special program you offer. Tuition discounts can be a fixed amount or a percentage of any combination of tuition, required fees, financial aid, and scholarships. Examples: Sibling discount Faculty-student discount Early enrollment discount Pay in full discount Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Contract Fees Contract Fee Rules Deposit &amp; Registration Fees Required &amp; Optional Fees",

    "body": "Overview Required Fees and Optional Fees are both types of contract fees that can be set up in your Finalsite Enrollment site and triggered on the contract for students using contract fee rules . These fees can be fixed amounts or a percentage of tuition (before or after financial aid and scholarship amounts). Required Fees Required fees come in many different forms but the core concept is that these are required amounts for the family to pay based on field data, as set on the contact record or provided in an online form or contract. Examples of required fees: Registration Fee Book Fee Technology Fee Special Program Fee Sports Fee Annual Fund Contribution Required fees can also be optionally collected at the time of contract submission by configuring them to be added to the deposit. See the deposit section for more information. Required fees can be fixed amounts or can be a percentage of the tuition amount. Let's look at an example with a Sports Fee. Within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Contract Fees , we can see that this is a required fee with a fixed amount. Within the contract, the required fee will display under the 'Additional Fees' section with the amount and a customized description of the fee as shown below. In addition, the required fee will also display in the 'Totals Summary' and can be included as part of the deposit, if this option was set on the contract fees page. When included as part of the deposit, all amounts due will be itemized and included in the 'Amount Due Now.' Manually Entered Required Fees Required Fees can also be manually assigned to a student, similar to Scholarships. They are entered on the contact record as fixed amounts and then they appear on the contract. The 'Display Name' for the field will appear on the contact record and on the contract as the fee name. Did you know? Both fixed Required Fees and manually added ones can be set to be added to the Deposit in order to be collected at the time of signing. How-To: Understand Optional Fees Optional fees are fees that can be selected by the parent on the contract by checking the appropriate box in the 'Optional Fees' section. The amount will then be added to the tuition and fees total, and can be included as part of the deposit if this option was set on the contract fees page Examples of optional fees: Hot Lunch Fee Bus/Transportation Fee Optional fees can be a fixed amount or a percentage. The percentage can be calculated based on any combination of tuition, required fees, financial aid, and scholarships. Optional fees can be shown based on business rules. How-To: Required Fees vs. Optional Fees By using a question and field on an earlier page of the contract, required fees can behave a lot like optional fees. So which should you use? Required fees have the following advantages and should be used: If the deposit is calculated as a percentage and the fee should be included as part of the calculation, required fees can be included but optional fees cannot. If the fee should be collected as part of the amount due at the time of contract signing. If pulling reports on the fees selected is desired. The data that drives the fee can be stored and reported on more easily. If your school wants to define defaults or if the parent selected that option in prior years and that selection can be carried forward. Optional fees have the following advantages and should be used: If you want the selection to be a part of the Tuition &amp; Fees overview page, rather than a prior page. If you need the percentage to include required fees. How-To: Set Up Percentage-Based Fees Percentage-based fees can be charges or discounts. This is most often used for payment plan fees that are discounts rather than added fees (for example, a discount for paying in full). Let's look at an example! Within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Contract Fees , we can see there's a 2% discount if a family pays in full. When we click on the Edit button to the right of the discount, the contract fee details window will appear. Here, we can see the 'Percent Of' option with various checkboxes. In the example below, we have the Pay in Full Discount configured to be: -2.0% of Tuition minus Financial Aid &amp; Scholarship Amount minus Tuition Discounts plus Required Fees Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Contract Fees Contract Fee Rules Tuition &amp; Tuition Discounts Deposit &amp; Registration Fees Payment Plans Overview",

    "body": "Overview Learn about the functionality and management options of the Deposit within Finalsite Enrollment. Vocab Desposit vs Registration Fee A sum of money that a parent/guardian is required to pay to secure a place for their child at school. Deposit is how this item is referred to throughout the Finalsite Enrollment system; however, you may call this the Registration Fee , Enrollment Fee, or anything else that works for your school. In this article Deposit Setup Notes How-To: Manage Deposit Payments Deposit Paid Email Receipt How-To: View Deposit and Fees Amount Due Now How-To: Edit the Customizable Text within your Contract How-To: Use Deposit Override Deposit Setup Notes A note about payment methods The payment methods chosen on the Deposit Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Deposit) determines the payment options available to parents on their contract and, for schools utilizing our Billing module, within their Billing Management tab. If you have Collect Deposit enabled under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Deposit, there must be a deposit active within your contract fees page for contracts to be generated. The deposit can either be a fixed amount or a percentage, which can be calculated based on a combination of tuition, tuition discounts, required fees, financial aid, and scholarships. You can customize the name of your Deposit under Settings &gt; Enrollment Setup, under the Contract Settings section. Use cases not well supported (at this time): Flat deposit amount based on tuition tiers. For example, a $1000 deposit if the tuition (after discounts and aid) is above $10,000 but $500 if the amount is less than $10,000. For scenarios like this, percentage-based deposits work better or schools can use Deposit Override to manually set the amount. How-To: Manage Deposit Payments Parent/Guardian Pays at the time of signing with a Credit Card or Electronic Check: In these cases, the deposit checklist item is marked complete automatically by the system. Parent/Guardian pays with Cash or Paper Check The deposit checklist item must be manually marked as complete on the student's record. Here's how: Navigate to the student's record. Click on the checkbox or click on the Edit text. This will open the Manual Payment box. Within the Manual Payment box, enter the amount, select the payment method from the drop-down menu, and enter the date of payment (optional). Click the Submit button to save. The checklist item will now be marked complete, and the payment amount, payment method, and date will be displayed. If you need to edit the amount or payment method, you can click on the text or edit pencil to reopen the Manual Payment window. If you need to edit the date, click on the date listed underneath the checklist item to update it. Deposit Paid Email Receipt Parents/guardians who pay the deposit electronically will receive an automated deposit receipt email. This template is system-generated, and not customizable or viewable within your communication templates. Below is an example of the template. The merge tokens within the template automatically transform into the correct text when sent. There is a note in red within the image. This is just for this article to show that the receipt language will change slightly based on the type of receipt it is. For Deposit payments, the receipt will contain the name of your deposit fee. How-To: View Deposit and Fees You can preview the student's deposit and fees on their record through the Manage Contract Menu. Options for previewing a student's tuition and fees on their record: Select Preview Contract and navigate to the totals page. If you have already generated the student's contract, you will have the additional option of selecting Preview Tuition &amp; Fees which brings up a window with a snapshot of the totals. Amount Due Now In addition to the deposit, you can set other contract fees to be due at the time of signing. These fees will appear in the Amount Due Now section of the Contract, which is an itemization of the fees that are due at the time of contract signing. How-To: Edit the Customizable Text within your Contract. Navigate to your contract page: Settings &gt; Forms &gt; Contract Forms In the Actions column on your active form, select Clone . Within the Draft section, in the Actions column, select Go to Advanced Form Editor . Navigate to the page containing the Tuition &amp; Fees by selecting Edit for that page. Find the Totals Summary section and expand it to reveal the editable text. After updating your text, save your changes, and, if you are ready, publish your draft. Editable Financial Text at a Glance Please note, your contract may be different and contain variations in text. Please use this as a general guide. Some edits can be made in the Basic Editor while others will require the Advanced Editor . Tuition and Program Fees. Editable in the Basic editor . Text under Tuition and Program Fees (you might not have this on your contract but it can be added if you'd like). Editable in the Basic editor . Total Amount Due. Editable in the Advanced Editor. Type = Tuition &amp; Fees. Totals Summary. Editable in the Basic editor . and 6. Editable in the Advanced Editor. Type = Totals Summary. Editable text: Custom Deposit Text (not pictured), Custom Payment Plan Text, Custom Total Text. How-To: Use Deposit Override The deposit amount may also be manually set by entering a value in the Deposit Override field on a student\u2019s contact record. You can find this field on the student record, under the Enrollment tab. Typically, it's listed under the Tuition &amp; Fees grouping as seen below. The amount entered into this field should be the amount you want the deposit to be for the student. For example, if you want the student's deposit to be overridden to $100, you would enter 100 into the Deposit Override field. If required fees are being added to the amount due, the deposit override will be added with any required fees due. Please note that deposit override is a term-based field , so it can store a unique amount per term.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment supports an extremely flexible payment plan system that can be customized to suit your school's needs. Payment plans include the following options: Multiple plan options, from 1 to 12 payments. Payment schedule with variable % due on each payment. Fees associated with payment plan selections. Customized descriptions and confirmation checkbox. Payment plan availability based on business rules. To view your Payment Plans for any term, go to Settings - Financial - Payment Plans in your Finalsite Enrollment site. On this page, you. can see which payment plans are currently active, the number of payments for each, and which have associated fees or payment schedules. You can also view the edit history and last edited date. Payment Plan Fees Associated fees can be calculated as a flat fee, a percentage, or a combination of both: The percentage can be based on any combination of tuition and required fees, before or after financial aid, scholarships, tuition discounts, or deposit. This also means the payment plan fee can also be assessed on either the pre-deposit or post-deposit amount. Payment plan fees can be added to the deposit amount due at the time of contract submission. An example is collecting a TRP fee at the same time as the deposit. Common examples: 1.5% payment plan fee for monthly payment option. 1.5% payment plan fee for monthly payments + $200 Tuition Refund Plan Option. International students only have pay in full option, domestic students have multiple payment plan options. Payment Plan Schedules Payment Plan Schedules allow you to display the due date and the amount due (expressed in the form of a percentage) for each payment. Each payment can be a different percentage due. This allows schools to configure a larger balloon payment prior to the school year with the remainder spread over the future payments. For schools using our Billing Module, payment plans are always calculated from the Net Tuition. For non-Billing schools, the percentage can be calculated from the Net Tuition or pre-deposit Gross Tuition. IMPORTANT: Payment Plan Schedules vary depending on your school's setup. Some schools handle billing through a third party such as FACTS, whereas some schools use the Finalsite Enrollment Billing Module. Please refer to the appropriate link below to learn how to set up payment plans and schedules: Schools using Finalsite Enrollment Billing Schools NOT using Finalsite Enrollment Billing Payment Plan Business Rules Each payment plan can be shown or hidden based on business rules that are driven by data on the student's contact record. For example, if international students are not eligible for payment plans, a business rule can be created so international students contracts do not show payment plan options, and only show the pay in full option, as shown below.

    "body": "Overview Contract fee rules are used to create dynamic, data-driven contracts without having to individually set amounts for each student. For example, you could have a fee rule based on grades or school level to distinguish between upper and lower school tuition, or you could have a fee rule to assess a required fee to only your international students. Please note that contract fee rules are only available to schools on our PRO plan and they must be added/edited by a member of our support team. How-To: View &amp; Use Contract Fee Rules Contract Fee rules are visible on the Contract Fees page under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Contract Fees. Admins must have financial permissions enabled to view this page and only members of our support team can add or edit contract fee rules. Within the Contract Fees page, you can see the rules attached to your contract fees. If a fee has a rule associated with it, you can expand the fee to see the details of the rule or rules attached. All line item fees (Tuition, Discounts, Deposits, Required Fees, Optional Fees, and Payment Plans) can be applied on a case-by-case based on business rules that trigger whether that line item applies to a given student's contract. Contract Fee rules can also trigger which payment plan options are available to different types of students. Contract Fee rules are flexible but the most common examples comprise of basic IS, IS NOT, AND, OR statements driven off data fields set on the student's record. Examples of Common Contract Fee Rules: school_level IS Lower day_or_boarding IS Boarding international_student IS true (yes) AND school_level IS Upper faculty_student IS NOT true (yes or blank) financial_aid_awarded IS false (no) grade IS 9th OR grade IS 10th If all of the conditions specified in the rule are met for a specific student, then that fee will be applied on their contract. A note about year-over-year behavior: If the fee depends on a field set on the contact record, this data may need to be updated each year. If not, it is possible for fees to appear that should not or for fees to not appear when they should. Many standard fields are term-based so they hold unique values per term and automatically clear upon rollover. These include fields like grade, school level, enrollment type (new or returning), financial aid amount, and scholarship amount. However, other common fields - like day/boarding, international, or faculty member - are non-term-based fields that need to be manually cleared and updated for the new term.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment calculates siblings who are enrolling or enrolled in your school by assigning each sibling a number, starting with the student in the highest grade and working down. This is known as Sibling Order (sibling_order), which is a magical field that can be used to give sibling discounts or to apply a certain fee to only the first student in a family. Please note that sibling order only applies for students in an active enrollment status . A sibling order number will not be assigned to siblings in inactive enrollment statuses (e.g. Not Enrolling) or in admissions. Here is an example where a family has three students - one in 11th grade, one in 9th grade, and one in 3rd grade - all enrolling in the school: 11th-grade sibling will be sibling_order = 1 9th-grade sibling will be sibling_order = 2 3rd-grade sibling will be sibling_order = 3 Siblings in the same grade, such as twins, are assigned two different numbers with the sibling who was created first (based on timestamp) in the Finalsite Enrollment system assigned a sibling order first. Sibling order will be recalculated any time a new sibling enters enrollment. This means if an older sibling enrolls at a later date, all siblings will have their sibling order number rest. How-To: Use Sibling Order to Assign Discounts/Fees Sibling order can be used in a contract fee rule to assign tuition discounts or fees based on which sibling order number a student has assigned to them. To get these fee rules set up, please contact our Support Team and include information about your fees and how you want them to be assessed to siblings. Example sibling discount structure: if sibling_order = 1 - full tuition amount - apply no discount if sibling_order = 2 - apply a 5% tuition discount if sibling_order = 3 - apply a 10% tuition discount Example family-based fee structure: if sibling_order = 1 - apply the family registration fee if sibling_order = 1 - do not apply the family registration fee This means that the registration fee would only apply to the contract for the first sibling (sibling_order = 1), and not any younger siblings. This is useful when you have fees that should be applied per family instead of per student . For families with only a single student attending, the fee will still be charged. Use case not supported via the sibling order feature: If there are multiple students attending the school, give a discount to all students including the first sibling. This cannot be accomplished via the sibling_order functionally. A flat field could be created if either set by the school or filled out by the family. How-To: Use Family Type to Assign Fees Because Finalsite Enrollment is a student-centric system, contracts are signed on a student-by-student basis, rather than a single contract that encompasses all siblings that are attending the school. If your school has a fee that is only charged once for the entire family, this can be accomplished by creating a fee that only applies to the first sibling (i.e. sibling_order = 1), as detailed in the section above . You can also assess fees and discounts based on whether a family is new or returning, using the magical field Family Type (family_type). Returning families are those who have at least one student who is returning to enroll in your school (i.e. enrollment_type = Returning), even if there are siblings who are new to the school (i.e. enrollment_type = New). New families do not have any students who have previously attended the school. Examples: if family_type = new - apply the new family fee of $500 if family_type = returning - apply the returning family fee of $200 Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Contract Fees Contract Fee Rules Tuition &amp; Tuition Discounts Roles &amp; Statuses Explained",

    "body": "Overview Within the Search &amp; Reports tab, you can create a variety of custom searches and reports, each of which can be saved for repeated reference at various points in your process to get the most up-to-date metrics. When saving a search, the results will update each time you refer back to it. A few useful examples of saved searches include admissions or enrollment counts, event registration, custom financial reports, and directories. How-To: Save a Search Once you've entered your search criteria, set your reporting view, and added any other data columns to your report, you can click on the Save button in the upper right. In the Save Current Search window that appears, you will be asked to: Enter a Name for the search. (Optional) Tag the search. You can read more about Tags, here . Set the Visibility: Shared: The search is visible on the Saved Searches page to all admin accounts that are set up in Finalsite Enrollment (except for Limited Users ). Private: The search is visible on the Saved Searches page ONLY to the person who saves the search. No other users will be able to see the search unless the visibility is changed to Shared. Once you have set the name, tags, and visibility for your search, click on the blue Save button to confirm. Your search will be accessible within the Saved Searches sub-tab moving forward. How-To: View &amp; Edit a Saved Search To view one of your existing saved searches, navigate to Search &amp; Reports &gt; Saved Searches. Within this page, you have the following columns: Name: This is the name of the saved search. You can open the search by clicking on the name. Report Type: This is the reporting view of the saved search (i.e. list, list with grouping, summary, or graph). Date Created: This is the date on which the saved search was created. Visibility: This will indicate if your search is private (visible to your admin account only) or shared (visible to all Finalsite Enrollment admin/user accounts). Owner: This is the name of the person who created or last updated the saved search. If the admin account associated with the person who created or last updated the saved search has been deleted, the owner column will say 'User deleted'. Tags: This column lists the name of the tags that are applied to the Search. You can read more about adding tags to searches and templates, here . Actions: Here you have two options: Edit will allow you to edit the search criteria, add/remove columns and change your reporting view.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment can store and, optionally, generate IDs for the multiple systems you may transfer data between. ID Usage Imports When importing data into Finalsite Enrollment, IDs are used to update existing records. Records imported without IDs create new records. Exports &amp; Integrations When exporting data from Finalsite Enrollment, shared IDs are used to reference existing records in the target system. Each system handles updates and ID creation differently, however, most systems update if there is a shared reference ID and create a new record if there is none. Shared IDs - Between Multiple Systems All records within Finalsite Enrollment can store or create multiple IDs. This is useful because not all systems can store multiple IDs or can store IDs in the same format. Using Finalsite Enrollment to create a shared ID There are many cases where using Finalsite Enrollment as your ID generation source of truth makes sense as data is passed downstream. The Finalsite Enrollment ID generation tool can create IDs based on rules that range from incrementing numbers to a combination of data pulled from the student record, for example, LAST NAME + FIRST NAME + DATE OF BIRTH. We can also match unique requirements such as leading zeros. Storing a shared ID from another system During the initial implementation process, we will import your existing students including any shared IDs from your third party system to facilitate future data transfer. Using another system, like an SIS, to create a new shared ID Some systems do let you create an ID upon importing new records from another system. In this case, the 3rd party system will need to create the ID and that ID will have to be returned to Finalsite Enrollment. For API level integrations (Blackbaud, Veracross), when a new record is passed to the SIS, it generates an ID and sends that back to Finalsite Enrollment. For other systems, the ID must either be manually entered or updated via import in Finalsite Enrollment. Household ID Generation Since IDs are assigned specifically to contacts using the Finalsite Enrollment ID generation system, additional entities linked to the contact, such as Households, can also have unique Identifiers set for them on export. This value will be based on the ID of the contact they belong to. A simple example would be a contact with an ID of \u201c250\u201d might have a household ID of \u201c250H1\u201d for their primary household or \u201c250H2\u201d for their secondary household. This ensures that the contacts easily stay in sync with their additional entities.",

    "body": "Overview To save time and keep consistency across your messaging, you can create text message templates to use whenever you send text messages through the Finalsite Enrollment system. How-To: Create a New Text Message Template To see your existing text message templates or create a new one, navigate to Settings &gt; Communications &gt; Text Message Templates. Within this page, click on the 'Add a new Text Message Template' text in the upper left to get started. Alternatively, if you have an existing text message template you want to clone from, you can click on the ' Copy' button to the right of that template on the page. Selecting 'Add a new Text Message Template' or 'Copy' will open the Template Editor. Please note: If you frequently send emails or create letters in Finalsite Enrollment, you will notice that the template editor looks a bit different. This is because the additional customization options (e.g. bold or color text, images, different fonts) will not work in a text message, as HTML formatting is not supported for text messaging. Because of this, you should be mindful when copying content from another source, such as emails. Within the Editor Template Name your template . The template name isn't parent-facing, so feel free to name it however is easiest for your team to remember. Text message templates will display in alphabetical order. Tag your template. Within the ' Tags ' field, you can create or select a tag to attach to the template. Tags are an internal-only way of organizing your communication templates. You can also add and remove tags in bulk within this page via the edit menu. You must select one or more templates before the ' Edit ' menu becomes available. You can read more about how to manage tags here . Type the content of your message and insert merge fields from the drop-down menus as needed to customize your content. This works the same way as your email and letter templates. Click here to learn more about merge fields. Additional Notes: Character Limit: We recommend limiting text messages to 160 characters if you want to ensure all carriers receive a single message. Texts longer than 160 characters may be split into multiple messages depending on the carrier. The maximum amount of characters allowed is 320. School Name: You should always include your school name in all templates. This is critical due to the delivery phone number being the same for all schools using Finalsite Enrollment. The merge tokens that can be used to pull in your school name are {{school.name}} and {{school.name_long}}. Rather than copying them from this article, you should insert them using the merge token picker. Copying/pasting merge tokens may result in their malfunction. The names that the template inserts are coming from what you have set up within Settings &gt; General &gt; Basic Setup within the Name and Long Name fields. Text Replies: If a parent replies directly to a text message, their response will not be received. We recommend including a note within the message to inform the recipient of this. You may also wish to include a reply-to number or another method to contact you in response. Opt-In/Opt-Out: You should include instructions on how they can opt out and opt back into your messages. Click here for a list of opt-in/opt-out commands, located under the 'Parent Subscription Management' section. If a parent opts out of a message, you will see this indicated as a send error on the ' Text Message History ' page. Remember to click on the ' Save' button to save your template for future use. How-To: Edit or Delete a Text Message Template If you need to edit or delete an existing text message template, you can click on the corresponding links along the far right of the page as shown below. Please note that deleted templates cannot be recovered. Filter Options and Edit Menu Filter Options Within the Text Message Template page, you can use the filter options to search for specific template tags or filter the results by template name. You can also filter by Blank to see any custom template that doesn\u2019t yet have a tag. Using Filter by Name allows you to search for templates based on their name.

    "body": "Overview When enrolling your families, it's important to have flexibility with contract access and financial communications. This is managed through the Financial Responsibility column, located on the Parent Portal Access tab of a student's record. Within this column, you can enable or disable financial responsibility for each contact. Admins can also use this setting to send emails to financially responsible parties or export this information as part of student data. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types : System Admin, Admin, and User Permissions: Financial Permission Note: Admins without financial permissions can still see the financial responsibility column, however, they cannot make any edits(toggle the permissions on/off). In this article Financial Responsibility Setup Financial Responsibility Functionality How to Enable or Disable Financial Responsibility How to email only financially responsible parents/guardians How to Export a List of Financially Responsible Contacts Using financial responsibility with dual signatures Frequently asked questions Financial Responsibility Setup The financial responsibility setting is located within a student's record on their Parent Portal Access tab. You can navigate there by clicking the Portal Accounts icon. By default, the following financial responsibility will be set within the ' Portal Accounts ' page of the student record: All parents/guardians : All contacts assigned the role of Parent or Guardian are automatically set to have Financial Responsibility toggled to ' yes ' within the student's record. Consultants : All contacts assigned the relationship and role of Consultant are automatically set to have Financial Responsibility toggled to ' yes ' within the student's record. Students : Have a hard-coded ' no ' set as students are not responsible for signing contracts. However, they can have access to the checklist if their portal access is set to ' yes .' Important note about enrollment checklist access: If a student is authenticated rather than a parent/guardian they will not be able to view the contract from this account. This is because student records cannot have financial responsibility, which is required in order to view the contract. Financial Responsibility Functionality When ' Financial Responsibility ' is toggled to ' yes ': Parents/Guardians will have access to the contract via the checklist item (once it's been generated). Admins can use this setting to send emails to financially responsible parties or export this information as part of student data. How to Enable or Disable Financial Responsibility Financial responsibility can be disabled by toggling it to ' No ' within the Parent Portal Access tab of the student record. A parent/guardian that has financial responsibility disabled will still see the contract checklist item listed, however, they will not be able to access and sign the contract as there will be no 'complete form' button that displays, and no printable PDF to view once it's been submitted by a financially responsible parent or guardian. Notes for schools using our Billing Module: Setting the Financial Responsibility toggle to ' No ' does not affect billing communications or access to the billing tab on the parent end. Anyone with a financial split percentage assigned to them will still receive billing communications and will maintain access to the billing management tab within the Parent Portal. If you wish to prevent a parent from receiving billing communications, their ledger should have a zero balance and they should be set with 0% financial responsibility. Financially Responsible Emails Sending email(s) to ' Financially Responsible ' contacts will send the email to any contact that has the toggle set to 'Yes.' How to Export a List of Financially Responsible Contacts The Financial Responsibility field for parents/guardians is located in the ' General Information' grouping within the ' Search &amp; Reports ' page &gt; ' Change/Display Columns. ' Once a search is created, you will have the option to export it from within the search page. How to pull financial responsibility into the search: Example search: How-To: Use the Financial Responsibility Flag with Dual Signatures All parents/guardians that have financial responsibility set to ' Yes ' will appear on the invite signer pages of dual signature contracts. Anyone with the toggle set to ' no ' will not display as an option. No other contacts can be invited to sign unless they're created in the student record, authenticated, and have the financial responsibility toggle set to ' yes. ' What if only one parent is assigned financial responsibility? If dual signatures are triggered, and only one parent is set as financially responsible, the school will need to enable access for a second parent/guardian or waive the requirement of a second signature for that family. How can you waive the requirement of a second signature for a family? This depends on your school's setup but you likely have a yes/no field built into the student record that allows you to disable the requirement of a second signature. This field is typically found under the student's enrollment tab and should be called ' Trigger Dual Signature ' or something similar. If you do not have this field, please contact Support to have it added. The contract can now be re-generated within the ' Manage Contract ' menu of the record so that only one signature is required. FAQs How are Parents Assigned Financial Responsibility? All contacts assigned the role of Parent or Guardian are automatically set to have Financial Responsibility toggled to 'yes' within the student's record. What does toggling Financial Responsibility to 'No' do? A parent/guardian without this flag enabled will be able to see the contract checklist item listed, but will not be able to access and sign the contract. Note for schools using our billing module: Setting the Financial Responsibility toggle to 'No' does not affect billing communications or access to the billing tab on the parent end. Anyone with a financial split percentage assigned to them will still receive billing communications and have access to the billing management tab within their account. For more on Financial Split percentage assignments, click here. Can parents turn Financial Responsibility on/off? No, parents do not have access to edit or view the financial responsibility permission.

You can configure custom templates for your text messages, and they can be sent in bulk from list pages or individually from the contact record, much in the same way as your emails. In this article Text Messaging Intended Use &amp; Disclaimer How-To: Collect Phone Numbers for Receipt of Text Messages International Phone Number Support How-To: Understand Supported Content, Characters, &amp; Styles Opt-In How-To: Manage Parent Subscription Text Messaging Intended Use &amp; Disclaimer Please note: Finalsite Enrollment's text messaging system is designed solely for parent/student communication within the inquiry, admissions, and/or enrollment process. Finalsite Enrollment text messaging is not designed or intended to be used as part of an emergency alert or crisis management system. Emergency and crisis management systems should include multi-channel communications such as text, voice, email, social media, website, and push notifications along with the appropriate delivery SLAs (such as delivery of notification within X number of minutes). Depending on the needs, it may also include check-in response features. How-To: Collect Phone Numbers for Receipt of Text Messages Phone Types Text messages will only be sent to phone numbers marked with the phone type of 'Cell' in the system. Phone type for any phone numbers already in the system can be edited within the student and parent records. If phone type information is not currently collected on your forms, you can start collecting it by either: Allowing parents to select a phone type: n the additional options for your form's phone field, make sure the phone type subfield is not hidden. This will allow parents to select the phone type (i.e. Home, Cell, or Work) from a drop-down menu when they complete the form. Setting a default phone type for phone fields: In the additional options for your form's phone field, set the Default Value to 'Cell'. This will set the phone type as 'Cell' for any phone number entered into that phone field so that text messages can be sent to it. Click here to learn about configuring these special section options on your forms. International Phone Number Support Currently, text messages can be sent to Canadian phone numbers. Other international numbers are not currently supported and will not be received. How-To: Understand Supported Content, Characters, &amp; Styles Traditional text messaging does not support custom fonts, text sizes, or text styles like bold and italic. Currently, text-only messages are supported. Images and video support will be evaluated in the future based on usage rates. An image and video support for schools may require additional service fees given transit costs are three times the text-only rates. We recommend limiting text messages to 160 characters if you want to ensure all carriers receive a single message. Texts longer than 160 characters may be split into multiple messages depending on the carrier. The maximum amount of characters allowed is 320. Opt-In If Cell is selected as the phone type within a form, a confirmation text will appear asking the parent/guardian to confirm whether or not they consent to receive text messages from the school. The message will contain your school's unique texting number. When someone opts out, an attempt to send them messages through text will fail. Read more about Opt-In for texts within our Text Message Opt-In article. How-To: Manage Parent Subscription Parents can reply with a start or stop message to manage their subscription, but message replies will not be received . They can reply with \"STOP\" to unsubscribe. Currently, it is not possible to allow recipients to opt-back in by replying to a text with \"Start\". If someone has opted out and would like to opt back in, they will need to opt back in when filling out a form. You can see if a parent unsubscribed within the text message history page. Best Practice: Select a stop message that you want to use and include this opt-out/opt-in information as part of the text message. Example: To opt-out, reply with \"STOP.\" Text Message Delivery Number &amp; Replies The initial text message (the first one you send) comes from a universal phone number that cannot be customized: (844) 330-8001. Parent replies to text messages will not be received . If they attempt to reply, their responses will not be received or stored. Best Practice: In your text messages, let your recipients know their replies will not be received, and include an alternative means of contacting you, if applicable. Insight: After you send your first text (which comes from (844) 330-8001), your school is given a unique text message number. This can't be customized but it will remain consistent so that parents and guardians can add this contact to their phones to recognize that it comes from your school. Pro Tip: It's always a good practice to add your school's name to the message body so that it's clear that the message is from you.

    "body": "Overview Text messages can be sent individually in the contact record or in bulk from a list page. Message content can be customized for one-time use or pre-defined text message templates can be used for bulk communications. Please note the following important information with regards to text messaging: Text Message Recipients: Text messages will ONLY be sent to phone numbers labeled with the 'Cell' phone type in the system. You can set this phone type as a default field value in your forms if it's helpful for your process. International Phone Number Support: Currently, text messages can be sent to Canadian phone numbers. Other international numbers are NOT currently supported and will not be received. Intended Use &amp; Disclaimer: Finalsite Enrollment text messaging is NOT designed to be used for emergency alerts or crisis management. Please review the full Text Messaging Intended Use &amp; Disclaimer information below. Availability: Text messaging is only available to schools on our PRO plan. Click to jump to a specific how-to section: Selecting Recipients Editing Text Message Content Previewing &amp; Sending a Text Message -- Text Messaging Intended Use &amp; Disclaimer Finalsite Enrollment's text messaging system is designed for parent communication within the inquiry, admissions, and enrollment process. Finalsite Enrollment text messaging is not designed or intended to be used as part of an emergency alert or crisis management system. Emergency and crisis management systems should include multi-channel communications such as text, voice, email, social media, website, and push notifications along with the appropriate delivery SLAs (such as delivery of notification within X number of minutes). Depending on the needs, it may also include check-in response features. -- How-To: Send Text Messages The process for sending text messages is similar whether sending an individual, one-off message, or sending multiple messages in bulk. If you frequently send emails through Finalsite Enrollment, these steps should be familiar as they are very similar to the send email process. To send an individual text message , navigate to the contact record for the student or parent/guardian you want to receive the message. Then, click on the green Communicate menu in the upper right and select Send Text Message. To send a message in bulk , go to a search or list page, apply any filters as needed, and then select the desired contacts by checking the box next to their name. Then, click on the green Communicate menu in the upper right and select Send Text Message. Once you have selected this option, the Send Text Messages window will appear, and you can follow the workflow to select your recipients and message content, as described below. -- Selecting Recipients On the first page of the Send Text Messages window, you will select who you want to receive the text message. There are multiple recipient options, as described below. Please note: Recipients will only receive a single text message if they are in multiple groupings. For example, if you select all parents of selected contacts and primary parents of selected contacts, the primary parent will only receive the text message once. Selected contacts - This will send a text message to the contacts selected on the list page/search or the contact record you are currently viewing. This can be used to send text messages directly to students, if they have a cell phone number set. All parents of selected contacts - Includes anyone with a parent, mother, or father role. This means it will include any aunts, uncles, and grandparents who have these role assignments. Primary parents of selected contacts - Refers to the parent or guardian with the primary parent flag set (noted as the orange 'P' icon to the left of their name) on the student's contact record . Financially responsible parents of selected contacts - Refers to any contact with 'Financially Responsible' set to Yes within the Parent Portal Access page of the student's contact record. All parents in the primary households of selected contacts - Includes anyone with a parent, mother, or father role in the primary household only. You can review who is in the primary household for a student by visiting the Household Details page on their contact record. Mothers of selected contacts - Refers to any contact with the 'mother' relationship set. This will also include any aunts, step-parents, and grandparents who may have the 'mother' relationship set. Fathers of selected contacts - Refers to any contact with the 'father' relationship set. This will also include any uncles, step-parents, and grandparents who may have the 'father' relationship set. Consultants of selected contacts - Includes all consultants tied to the student's record. On this page, you can also choose whether or not you want to send it as a family-based text message by checking the box. Family-based texts will only be sent once to each contact, even if they are responsible for multiple students within the selected search or list page. After you've made your choices, click the blue Next button. -- Editing Text Message Content On the second page of the Send Text Messages window, you will see a stripped-down version of the template editor. Please note: HTML formatting (e.g. bold or color text) does not work in text messages, so be mindful when copying content from another source, such as emails. Merge tokens DO work in text messages, which is useful if you want to address the student or parents, plug in your school's contact information, etc. You can insert merge tokens using the picker provided (directly above the main content box in the template editor). If you have a previously created text message template , you can select it here using the 'Insert Template' drop-down menu. Otherwise, you can write a custom message from scratch directly in the editor. A best practice is to let your recipients know that replies to the message will not be received. You can also include commands for them to opt out or opt back into your messages. The list of standard commands for opting in and out are included in the 'Parent Subscription' section of the Text Message Overview article. After you've added your desired message content, click on the blue Next button. -- Previewing &amp; Sending a Text Message On the final page of the Send Text Messages window, you will be able to preview your text message before sending it. All merge tokens will be populated with the appropriate data, so you can see exactly what the recipient will see when they get that text message on their phone. A note will display at the top of this page indicating the send window for your communications. It states that any messages sent outside of these hours will be held for delivery until the blackout period has ended. The send window hours can be adjusted from Settings - Communication - Text Messaging Setup . REMINDER: Text messages will ONLY be sent if there's a cell phone listed for the recipient(s) selected.If your selected contacts do not have a cell phone number in the system, they will not be able to receive your text message. After previewing your text message and confirming that it looks the way you want, click the blue Submit button to send the text message to your selected recipients. The system will confirm how many recipients the message was sent to. Click the Done button to exit. You can monitor the delivery status of your text messages from within Settings - Communication - Text Message History . -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Text Messaging Overview &amp; Best Practices Setting the Text Messaging Send Window Text Message Templates Text Message History",

Displayed times are in your school's local time zone, as configured within Basic Setup . Click the blue Submit button to save your changes! No text messages will be sent outside of the hours selected on this page, which means any messages that are set up past the window will go out the following day at the set start time.

    "body": "Overview The Household Membership page, within the Households tab of the contact record , allows you to manage which contacts live in each household associated with the contact. Click here to return to the Contact Record Overview. How-To: Use the Household Membership Tab Access the Household Membership page by going to any contact record, then clicking on the Households tab - Household Membership sub-tab. Within this page, you will find the following information: Contact List: All contacts that are related to the current record will be listed in the first column. The contact record that you are currently viewing will be at the top of the list, highlighted in orange. The role of the contact will be listed underneath their name with the relationship to the current record displayed in parentheses. Household 1: The primary household is listed in the second column, with the address displayed near the top. The checkboxes below allow you to mark who lives in the house and who does not. Simply check the circles to update residency information. Please note: The student and primary parent MUST live in the primary household. If you hover over the checkmark for these contacts, you will see a warning message that the contact/primary parent cannot be removed from the primary household. The primary parent can be switched, however, and then moved to another household. Household 2: If there is a second household, it will display in the third column, with the address displayed near the top. The checkboxes work the same way as in the primary household, except none of the contacts will be locked. The same applies to any additional households that are listed. Add Household: If you need to add an additional household, click on the green plus sign, fill out the fields, and click the blue Save Household button. Primary Parent: The primary parent is designated on this page by the orange (P) icon . The primary parent cannot be removed from the primary household without first assigning a different contact as the primary parent. To re-assign the primary parent, simply click the orange icon and select a new contact to make the primary parent. Pro Tip If you ever have a family where no parent/guardian has been assigned as the primary parent (i.e. no one has the orange P icon), try to correct this on the Parent Portal Access tab of the student. Simply toggle Portal Access to No and then back to Yes for that parent. This should prompt the parent to be assigned the orange P. Check the Household Membership tab to see if it's been assigned. If that doesn't fix it, contact support and we can help you out. Financially Responsible: Financially responsible contacts are designated on this page by the orange ($) icon. To add or remove financial responsibility for any contact, visit the Parent Portal Access page. Add Related Contact: If you need to add any related contacts, you can click on the green plus sign and type in the name. This works the same way as it does in the household details page and on the summary tab of the contact record .

    "body": "Overview Within the Parent Portal Access Page on the contact record , you can manage authentication , parent portal access, and financially responsible contacts . Click here to return to the Contact Record Overview. How-To: Use the Parent Portal Access Page When you are viewing a contact record, you can access the Parent Portal Access Page by clicking the clock icon along the right side of the contact navigation bar. If you hover over it, you'll see the ' Portal Accounts ' label. Alternatively, you can access this page by clicking on the Households Tab - Parent Portal Access. Within this page, you will see a list of all associated accounts for the contact you're currently viewing. For the student, this will include themselves, as well as any parents, guardians, or consultants related to them. Please note: At this time, only contacts with a parent/guardian or consultant type relationship can have parent portal access. If you have another type of contact needing access (e.g. a grandparent), assign them a relationship of 'Guardian' from 'Related Contacts' on the summary tab . The Associated Accounts list contains the following columns: Contact: The name of the contact. Code: If the contact's account is not yet authenticated, the authentication code they can use to manually authenticate will appear here. This is useful if you need to read the authentication code over the phone to a parent/guardian. Linked Account: If the contact's account has been authenticated, this is where you can see the name and email address used to create the account. For contacts who are not yet authenticated, this will only display the name, not the email. Portal Access: This allows you to click to enable or disable access to the student and their checklist in the Parent Portal. This is always enabled for the student, since they often need to complete items as part of the admissions process. However, if they do not create a Parent Portal Account, then they won't have access to their checklist. Fin. Respon.: This allows you to click to enable or disable financial responsibility for a contact. All parents/guardians have the financial responsibility setting enabled by default. Financial responsibility gives access to the contract and some additional enrollment/billing items - Click here for more information. Please note: Students cannot be financially responsible. This also means that if a student is the one authenticated, instead of a parent/guardian, they will not be able to view or complete the contract in the Parent Portal. Fin. Split: This option will only show for schools using the Finalsite Enrollment Billing Module. This allows you to view and change the current financial split percentages. Click here for more information. Actions: For contacts with an authenticated Parent Portal Account, you will see the option to \"Manage Authentication\", which allows you to revoke authentication for the selected account or associate the account with a different contact. For contacts without an authenticated Parent Portal Account, you will see the option to \"Send authentication code\", which allows you to email an authentication link to the contact. Click here for more information. Password Reset: For contacts with an authenticated Parent Portal Account, you can use this button to send a password reset email to their account email. You will be asked to confirm the action. Click here for more information. For authenticated accounts, you can also see some additional information, under the '[Contact Name]'s Account' section. This will tell you the account authentication status (i.e. authenticated or unauthenticated), the account login email, and the last login date and time for the account. For student records, this section will be below the list of associated accounts. For parent/guardian and consultant records, it will be the only thing on the Parent Portal Access page.

    "body": "Overview Custom Statuses help schools define where their students are throughout the process, using their own terminology. For example, you may want a custom status to flag which families have been interviewed during the Admissions process or which families in Enrollment are on hold for a specific reason. *Important Note: Custom statuses are internal-facing only , and are not visible to parents in the Parent Portal. How-To: Create a Custom Status For any Admin with data permissions , you can navigate to Settings-- Fields &amp; Data-- Custom Statuses to create a new custom status. Click on the green plus sign next to Custom Statuses in the upper left to add a new status. The Custom Status Details window will open. Within this window, you will set the following: Name: This is the name of your custom status, which is internal-facing only and not visible to parents. It must be typed in all lowercase, as indicated in the details window. Using underscores will create a space in the name. For example, to add a custom status named 'Conditional Accept', you would input ' conditional_accept' as the name. Stage: This indicates in which stage of the Admissions or Enrollment process you want the custom status to appear. You can see a list of all stages and what statuses comprise each stage within the current counts section of your Dashboard . Type: This indicates the type of custom status you are creating. Choose from three options: Active: This indicates that the student is still active and working their way through the Admissions/Enrollment workflow. Inactive : This indicates that the child is no longer active in the workflow at a particular stage of the process. Waitlist: This indicates a custom reason for a student to be waitlisted. Click the Submit button to save your status. After a couple of minutes, you should see your custom status in the assigned stage within the current counts of your Dashboard , in your filter options , and within search and reports . How-To: Edit or Delete a Custom Status For any Admin with data permissions , you can navigate to Settings-- Fields &amp; Data-- Custom Statuses to view your existing custom statuses. On this page, you have the ability to Edit or Delete any status by clicking on these actions along the right side. Please note: While you can edit the Type of custom status (i.e. active, inactive, or waitlist), you cannot edit the Name or Stage for an existing custom status. If you need to change one of these options, you will need to create a new custom status, delete the existing one, and merge the two. Read the section below for details. If you need to delete a custom status, you will need to select a fallback status. All contacts with the custom status you are deleting will be merged into this fallback status. You can choose any standard or custom status as the fallback status. Click the Submit button to confirm the delete and merge action. It may take a couple of minutes for all students to be changed to the new status.

    "body": "Overview Scheduled exports are exports that can be delivered via SFTP on a regular basis. In the future, Finalsite Enrollment will also offer scheduled exports through email. To create a scheduled export, your school must first have a pre-existing export that they would like delivered on a regular basis, as well as an SFTP server configured to receive the data. -- How-To SFTP Setup For this step, it is assumed your school has a pre-existing SFTP server or has created one for these exports. To begin creating a scheduled export, go to 'Settings' -- 'Fields &amp; Data' -- 'SFTP Setup' . If you cannot see this tab, check with your System Administrator to make sure you have data permissions. Once on this page, you will see the following options: SFTP Host Name Port (optional) SFTP Username SFTP Password Fill in this information, including the 'Port' if your SFTP server has firewall rules configured. You can use the 'Test Connection' button to test the server and confirm we are able to reach it. When you are done, be sure to click 'Save' at the bottom of the page. On this page, you can also take note of the IP addresses that Finalsite Enrollment SFTP exports may come from, and ensure that your firewall is configured to allow incoming connections from them on port 22. Create Scheduled Export Now that the SFTP server has been configured, go to: 'Settings' -- 'Fields &amp; Data' -- 'Scheduled Exports' and click ' Create a Scheduled Export '. This will bring up a similar screen to running a non-scheduled export. It may help to review the article on Running a Data Export if you are unfamiliar with the export options. From this screen, the user will select the export configuration, the saved search, and which records to include (all or since last export). If you're familiar with a non-scheduled export, these steps are the same. For a scheduled export, you also have to set the following: Schedule - This option sets the schedule type. Each schedule type is listed below. Each export will arrive on the scheduled day at approximately 3:30 AM CST. Weekly - Exports will be delivered every Monday. Daily - Exports will be delivered every day. Monthly - Exports will delivered on the first of every month. Delivery Method - There are two export delivery options available to you. SFTP - A valid SFTP configuration must be created before a scheduled export can be saved, as described above. Email - Deliver export to an email or list of emails, configured in the 'List emails separated by commas' box below. Once the scheduled export is created, it can be saved, edited and deleted at any time. Multiple scheduled exports can exist, each linked to different searches or configs. Email Notification Once the scheduled export is complete, the user that ran the export will receive an email. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings How to Save and Export a Search Data Export",

    "body": "Overview Checklist items are central to the Finalsite Enrollment system. Checklists drive flexible workflows that enable the collection of information, automated reminders or communications, and the ability to move prospective and current families through your process in a clear, timely manner. This article will explain some of the core concepts of the Finalsite Enrollment checklist, such as checklist visibility and business rules, as well as best practices and use cases. For even more information, see the following help articles: Checklist Management &amp; Settings : Learn more about how to set up checklist items and configure their settings, such as parent explanations and additional criteria. Checklist Item Types : Learn more about the different checklist item types available to you and how to use them in your admissions and/or enrollment workflow. How-To: Understand Core Concepts The following core concepts apply to almost all checklist items. They are useful to understand as you design your admissions and enrollment processes. Checklist Visibility Checklist items can be any of the following: Required: Required checklist items are those that you require to be completed prior to considering a student complete in the admissions or enrollment process. If all required items on a checklist are completed, the status for that student will automatically transition from Application to Application Complete or from Enrollment in Progress to Enrolled . Optional: Optional checklist items are those that you do not require to be completed prior to considering a student complete in the admissions or enrollment process, but that certain students may want to complete. Some examples of optional checklist items include additional recommendation forms and bus transportation forms. In the Parent Portal, any optional checklist items appear at the bottom of the student checklist under an Optional Steps heading. Internal: Internal checklist items can only be viewed by your internal team on a student's contact record. Internal items are never visible in the Parent Portal. Some examples of internal checklist items include additional document uploads and interview notes. Internal checklist items must also be set to Optional when configuring the checklist. Please note: If you retire or remove a required checklist item after students have entered the Inquiry, Applicant, or Enrollment in Progress status, those students will no longer automatically change to status Inquiry Complete, Application Complete, or Enrolled, respectively. This is because if there are ten required checklist items after contacts entered the Inquiry, Applicant, or Enrollment in Progress status, and then the checklist is changed to have eight required checklist items, the system will still look for those remaining two checklist items. This means you will need to manually move these students into a completed status. Permission set Within the Permission Set dropdown, you can set granular permissions within Checklist Items to control who can see/edit/view the item and the data related to the item. Granular Permissions allow you to hide information on your site based on the permission level of the individual user. Pro-Tip: Granular Permissions can also be added to Email Templates. Check out our Granular Permissions for Emails and Checklists article to learn more! Checklist Business Rules Business rules can be used to determine when a checklist item applies to a specific student. For example, you might want certain items to show only for international students or students who have indicated an interest in financial aid. Business rules are calculated in real-time and are dynamic based on information received or steps in the process being completed. Through business rules, you can create a process that only shows the necessary items to your prospective families, increasing completed applications while reducing confusion and questions about which steps remain. Common examples: Additional forms for new students vs. returning students Unique recommendation forms for upper school vs. lower school Additional items for international students Different student visit calendars based on grade If you'd like to add a business rule to one or more of your checklist items, please contact our support team. Terms Terms allow you to set start and end dates for when the checklist item should appear. As a best practice, you should always include a start term. If you want the item to continue to appear in the checklist, year after year, leave the End Term set to the asterisk icon. If your process changes in a new year, you can retire old checklist items or start new checklist items without affecting the previous year. Terms also affect which forms are associated with a given checklist. This is particularly important in enrollment as contracts and associated forms often change year to year. Automatic Reminders &amp; Communications Checklist items can trigger automatic reminders and notifications. These can be powerful in helping keep you, school staff, and parents abreast of updates in the process. They are fully customizable so that they can include personalized information.

Best Practices &amp; Additional Use Cases Online Transcripts / School Records You can use Finalsite Enrollment to collect transcripts and school records by combining Document Request Forms with a form that contains an embedded file upload option. Test Scores Schools typically receive test scores directly from test agencies. A Basic type checklist item can be used to communicate key information to the parent/student, such as which test to take and instructions for sending the results to your school, and when those test scores have been received (by marking the checklist item as complete when you receive the scores in your office). Test Score Registration For schools that host testing, such as the High School Placement Test (HSPT), Finalsite Enrollment can provide a way for applicants to register and pay for the test. You can use an Online Form checklist item and a Custom Fee to set this up. Evaluation &amp; Interview Forms If your school has evaluation sessions or student interviews with school staff who are not in Finalsite Enrollment, Document Request Forms can be sent to those who performed the evaluation or interview to collect their feedback. Forms have the benefit of collecting structured feedback that can then be incorporated into your online review process . Intent to Enroll You can use an Online Form to survey new or returning parents on their intent to enroll at your school. This can help improve yield and retention, plan class sizes, and drive follow-up actions based on their response. Scholarship Application Forms Collect scholarship application information as part of the admissions or enrollment process. Scholarships can be awarded and discounted from Tuition as part of the enrollment contract. SAO Integration Finalsite Enrollment integrates with the Student Application Online from EMA. Individual components of the SAO process can be linked to checklist items in Finalsite Enrollment. Click here to learn more about the SAO Integration.

If your school is using Payments, please reference this article instead for the most up-to-date information. If your school would like to set up your complimentary migration to Payments, please contact the Support Team . Is Stripe secure? Will I be PCI compliant? Yes! Stripe meets and exceeds the most stringent industry standards for security. They are also audited by a PCI-certified auditor and are certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. (This is the highest level of certification available.) You can learn more about the technical details of Stripe's secure infrastructure here: https://stripe.com/docs/security/stripe You can see Stripe\u2019s PCI certification here. What is Plaid? Plaid is an enabling technology to instantly authenticate ACH transfers. It is integrated directly into Stripe. To learn more, click here . How are funds transferred to my school? Once you\u2019ve made your first charges with Stripe, your first payout will be initiated and should post within 7 days. Thereafter, all US-based merchants will receive payouts of your available account balance on a rolling 2-day schedule (which is the standard schedule for the US), unless you've defined a custom payout schedule. Payout schedules vary slightly for merchants outside of the US. You can see your country\u2019s schedule here . When a payment is first received, it is initially reflected as a pending balance (less any Stripe fees). This balance becomes available according to your payout schedule. For instance, it takes seven calendar days from a payment being received to it being paid out for Stripe accounts on a 7 calendar day schedule. Most banks deposit payouts into your bank account as soon as they are received, though some may take a few extra days to make them available. You can set your bank account and set the frequency of these payouts (daily, weekly, monthly, etc) in the Payouts tab of your Stripe dashboard. From there, you can also view all payouts from Stripe to your bank account. To learn more, visit Stripe's documentation on payouts . Processing Time 1-3 days for Credit Cards 4-7 business days for ACH payments Example of a rolling 2-day payout: A payment is made via ACH on Monday, January 13th, 2020. It will process 4-7 business days later. Our current 2-day payout schedule will process payments on the 13th, 15th, 17th, 21st, 23rd, 27th, 29th, and 31st of the month. This payment is processed 7 business days later (because of the 4-7 day window), which is the 22nd. Notice how this is not a date in our rolling 2-day payout schedule above. This means the payment won\u2019t be paid out until the next payout scheduled date, which is the 23rd even though it was processed on the 22nd. How can I issue a refund? You can issue refunds via your Stripe dashboard. Depending on your customer\u2019s bank, he or she will see the refund show up anywhere between 5-10 business days later. Credit card refunds can be whole or partial \u2013 that is, you can refund any amount up to the original amount of the charge. Bank accounts can only be fully refunded, not partially. Click here for more information . What is a chargeback/dispute? How do I handle them? A dispute occurs when a cardholder questions a charge with their bank or credit card company. Depending on the reason, the Stripe dashboard will guide the user through submitting the best kind of evidence for each reason. When a dispute comes in, Stripe gets information about it from the bank and displays one of eight reasons to our users. Here are some best practices on the type of evidence to submit based on the dispute reason. Once you submit your dispute evidence to Stripe, Stripe submits your evidence to the banks/card networks on your behalf, so you do not have to deal with them directly. To be notified about disputes, select email notifications through your dashboard (Select \"Email me for: Disputes\u201d). Here are some overall best practices for avoiding fraud. What will my customers see on their credit card statements? You can customize this to match your business name or anything more specific you might like. Go into your Stripe Account Settings and look for a setting called \"Statement Descriptor\". How to Contact Stripe Stripe provides 24/7 real-time support . To help them solve your issue as quickly as possible, we recommend formatting your inquiry with the respective IDs, such as: Customer Name: Johnny Example Customer Email: johnny@example.com Any other relevant Stripe IDs: Charges begin ch_*** or py_*** Transfers begin tr_*** , etc. If it\u2019s regarding a specific card, please include as much information about the card as possible, such as the expiration date, the last 4 digits of the card number, and the card brand. Please never share or send a full card number or CVC. After submitting your inquiry via the form, Stripe will send a confirmation email that they've received your message.

    "body": "Overview While online forms are often the best way to collect information, many schools still intake a lot of hard-copy (paper) forms and documents from applying or enrolling families. Additionally, there are many times when information is coming from multiple sources, such as receiving recommendations via your parent portal, via paper or PDF, and from EMA's Standard Application Online (SAO). This can be a challenge because while the overall process is similar, the checklist item needs to support multiple input sources. This article will discuss how to upload files from the admin side to complete online form checklist items for a student. The ability for admins to upload to a form checklist item helps reduce supplemental and duplicate checklist items while streamlining configuration management and reporting. Who has access to this page? Types: System Admin, Admin, User Permissions: You have to have Admissions and/or Enrollment permissions to have access to those checklists on the student record. In this Article How-To: Upload Files to Form Checklist Items Additional Notes How-To: Upload Files to Form Checklist Items All form-based checklist items (e.g. applications, custom forms, online recommendations) include the ability for admins to upload a file to that checklist item. This option is only available on the admin portal - parents/students will not be able to upload files to an online form-type checklist item. To do this, first, navigate to the contact record of the student for whom you want to upload files. Once you are on their record, find the item on their checklist and click the Upload text to the right of it. After selecting and uploading the desired file, the checklist item will be marked as complete from the admin and parent portal side. Once you've uploaded a file you will see Manage Files instead of Upload. Selecting this will give you the additional option of: Uploading a new file Editing the file name Deleting the file Downloading the file Additional Notes If you have several files for different students to upload, this functionality is also available via the Bulk File Upload tool as well. If this checklist is used in the Online Review process, the uploaded file will appear there for your readers to review.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment Billing is a natural extension of the enrollment and contract process after all of the tuition and fees are set within your site. It's a tight integration between enrollment and the billing process which avoids having to feed all of the data into a third-party system with an additional log-in for parents. This seamless process helps schools stay connected with their families because they have better control over the messaging and the process. It also saves parents time from going into another system as well as the school's time to set up the transfer of its fees into another system. Pop some Popcorn! Be sure to check out our collection of Billing videos here: Finalsite Enrollment Video Library To get started with Finalsite Enrollment Billing, review the items below to set up and customize your process. Click here to review important Billing terminology Payment Plans and Schedules You can view all payment plans and their details within Settings--Financial--Payment Plans . You'll need the following items set up for each payment plan: Make sure all payment plans have a schedule. All payment plans need a payment due date and a percentage amount due. Payment plans and schedules must be displayed within the contract. Within this page, you\u2019ll see a red triangle if a schedule hasn't been set up for the payment plan. Resources Click here for general information about payment plans and schedules. Click here to learn how to set up payment plans and schedules. Billing Categories Overview Within Settings--Financial--Billing Categories , you'll need to review existing billing categories and set up any additional billing categories as needed such as late fees or activity fees. Most billing categories will be applied to the student, except in cases where the parent is solely responsible for the amount, such as late fees. Billing Category Order IMPORTANT: The billing categories must be organized in the order that you want payments to be applied, based on the balance due. When an automatic payment is processed, that payment is applied to the balance due in the order of the categories on this page. Let's look at an example: Each parent has a ledger with a total amount due. This amount is comprised of tuition, general fees, etc. Say Parent A has a balance of $1,000, where $800 of that is for tuition and $200 is for additional fees. If the parent makes a payment of $500 and Tuition is the first billing category listed, then that $500 will all go towards the Tuition since it's the first one in the list. This also means that if they make another payment of $500, then $300 of that will go towards the tuition to finish paying that amount off, and the last $200 will go towards additional fees. Fee Allocation Parents can overpay or underpay the amount due, however, they can not allocate what fees their money is applied to. This is dictated by the billing category order and where there's a remaining balance. You can read more about overpayment behavior in this article. Resources Click here to learn how to set up Billing Categories Payments To use Finalsite Enrollment Billing, your school must have Payments set up. Please refer to the help articles below on how to get set up with your Deployment Specialist or a member of our Support team. Resources Payments: Overview &amp; FAQ Payments: Setup and Onboarding Parent Portal Templates: Terms of Service Within Settings--Portal--Parent Portal Content , there's an ' Autopay Terms And Conditions' template that needs to be customized. Each school is responsible for defining their terms of service, which is a requirement for participation in Autopay/auto-withdrawals. Email Templates and Automated Communication Plans Within Settings--Communication--Email Templates , you'll need to customize the automated templates for payments and statements found in the billing tab. Resources Click here to learn about Billing Email Templates. Click here to see what emails get sent at various key points in the billing process. Financial Responsibility Schools can decide if they want to set up parent/guardian financial responsibility prior to contract generation or later on after contract generation. It only needs to be set up once and these settings will save year over year but can be manually adjusted on a yearly bases. How are split payments/percentages handled? The default split is set to 0% until contract submission. The parent that submits the contract and pays the deposit is automatically set as 100% financially responsible. However, if split payments or percentages were defined prior to contract generation or submission, then, financial responsibility will be dictated by these values.

    "body": "Overview Billing categories are used to classify groups of contract charges. You can manage them within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories . Billing categories can have groups, within these groups, there can be multiple charges and multiple credits per group. To learn to add new categories and category groups, continue reading. Example: If your school has multiple tuition categories, lower, middle, and upper, you can group them together along with your tuition credit categories. You also have a prepaid billing category that redistributes credits/payments to billing categories with positive charges every day. Please note: While this article contains information for all schools, some parts of it (such as references to the ledger) will only apply to schools utilizing our Billing module. Create a New Billing Category Group IMPORTANT: Make sure you read the \" Billing Category Setup Best Practices \" article so that you do not create more categories than what we recommend for clean reporting and streamlined ledger views. To add a new billing category group, click on the green plus sign --&gt; Add New Billing Category Group. Billing Category Settings Applies to Student Balance: Categories that apply to a student balance describe charges and credits that will be applied to a student, such as Tuition, Trip Fees, etc. This is the default for all billing categories. An example of a category that does not apply to a student is a late fee, which is assessed to individual payers. Late fees are optional as part of your billing setup and will not be assigned by default. They're also dependent upon your grace period if one is set. Excluded from Automatic Overpayment Logic: When a parent/payer overpays, the additional amount would be applied based on the next outstanding ledger items, however, it would ignore any billing categories with this 'Excluded' flag set. Revenue Recognition Start Month: Set the start month for each category grouping to appear in the revenue recognition report. Revenue Recognition End Month: Set the end month for each category grouping to appear in the revenue recognition report. Revenue Recognition Allocation Rule: Set the allocation rule for each category, which will be reflected in the revenue recognition report. Click here to read more about the Revenue Recognition Report. View Edit History When you click on ' View Edit History ,' you'll have the option to select the subcategory that you want to audit. The ' Recent Edit History ' will display the user that made the change, the date that the change was made, and what changes were made to what fields/settings. Moving Categories Moving a category allows flexibility to structure your category groups. You can only move one category at a time. You can move categories into inactive categories, which will automatically make them inactive. While moving, you have the ability to distinguish the category type, in case you need to change it. Example: If there is only one credit category, within a charge group, you will have to move the credit category first, before you can move the charge category. Editing Along the far right, you can click on ' edit ' for each billing category to update the details displayed within this page. *Important Note about editing billing categories* If there is a balance in a student category, and you are trying to change it to be a parent/ account category, or the reverse of this, you will not be able to perform this change. You will be prompted with a validation error. A best practice would be to make a new category, this way it will not cause any problems with reporting. View Edit History Within a category group, you will be able to see all previous changes made within that category. If there are multiple subcategories, you can click one and see the changes made specifically for that subcategory. Once you have clicked inside a category to see the recent edit history, it will look similar to this. Showing the previous state of the category to the left of the arrow, and the current state of the category to the right of the arrow. To add a new credit category or charge category, click the corresponding green plus sign at the bottom of the category group. Name: The name of the billing category used to classify ledger items. A billing Category needs to be created for each Account Code. Contract fees are associated with corresponding billing categories, and multiple fees can be applied to each. Account Codes: This field is specific to FACTS clients, however, you can add account codes for your own internal reference for your GL. Please note, that these codes aren't currently available in search or an export and don't drive any behaviors in the system for Billing customers. Adjustment Codes: This field is specific to FACTS clients, however, you can add adjustment codes for your own internal reference for your GL. Adjustment codes are set for any credits, and they provide the description for why a credit is applied to an account. Please note, that these codes aren't currently available in search or an export and don't drive any behaviors in the system for Billing customers. Ledger Account Code: Schools can define a general account code for each billing category. This code is available within Billing export templates, the Ledger Report, and the Payout Report. Save: Click this button to save any changes or additions that were made while editing. If you close the dropdown without clicking save, it will erase anything you edited. How Payments Are Applied Payments are allocated based on both billing category and term . When a payment is posted to a ledger, the payment applies based on all outstanding balances in the earliest term and applies the payment based on the order of the billing categories. To put it simply, if a parent owes a balance in more than one term, their payment will cover the older term's balances in all categories before starting to apply the payment to the more recent term. Let's look at an example. Example Billing Category Order: Tuition Category General Fees Category Sample Criteria: Student Balance is $1,200 $100 is for 21-22 Tuition $200 is for 21-22 General Fees $500 is for 22-23 Tuition $400 is for 22-23 General Fees Given the example ledger above, if a parent pays $500, the payment will apply as follows: $100 goes to 21-22 Tuition $200 goes to 21-22 General Fees $300 goes to cover part of the $500 charge for 22-23 Tuition Note how the payment first went to cover the 21-22 outstanding charges, based on the order of their category, then, it started applying to the 22-23 charges. The parent can't allocate where the amount goes, however, the school can make this adjustment within the payer's record if needed. This means that we're allowing parents to overpay or underpay the amount due, based on the order of the billing categories. *Important Note about Payments* If a credit category has a positive amount a payment will not be applied to this. We only apply payments to charges and charge categories. Within the ' Balances ' tab in a billing account's ledger, the category groups display with the carat dropdown, it will show all of the credits and balances inside of that category group as seen below. Those balances sum up to the total of the charge group. *Important Note about Billing Category Order* The term the charge is owed in and the order of the categories on this page determine the precedence when applying payments and discounts to billing balances. Categories higher on the list will have discounts applied to them before categories lower in the list. To set the order of your billing categories, drag and drop them by clicking on the icon to the left of each billing category name. This applies within the category groups as well.

    "body": "Overview The Billing Management tab in the Parent Portal allows parents to manage all tuition and fee payments and a history of payments made. In this article Contract Process Billing Management Tab Manual Payments and Autopay Update Payment Details Shared Access Billing for Inactive Statuses Automated Reminders and Emails Contract Process Parents/Guardians will access your school's contract/registration form within the checklist of the Parent Portal. They'll select their payment plan and any other options you have listed within the contract. Note: Payment plans MUST be set up with schedules. Click here to learn more. The contract will then be signed by one parent/guardian, or by two if your school is using dual signatures. Click here to learn more about dual signatures. If using dual signatures, either parent/guardian can pay the deposit and enter their payment information. If enabled by your school, they can also check a box to enroll in Autopay for tuition payments. Important Notes: The parent who pays the deposit is set with 100% financial responsibility (unless you are using the Split Contracts feature.) Unless you are utilizing our Split Contracts feature , the parent/guardian that pays the deposit, will be assigned 100% financial responsibility for billing payments. It can be adjusted at any point in time after contract signing to reflect a split within the student record. Split Contracts is a feature that will automatically divide the amounts owed on a student contract based on the percentage of financial split assigned to the student\u2019s parent/guardian(s). Learn more about Split Contracts within this article: Billing: Split Contracts. If you require Autopay but do not collect a deposit payment on the contract, the parent's payment information will still be saved when completing the contract but no payment will be collected on the contract itself. If you are requiring autopay but not collecting a deposit or any other fees at the time of contract signing, parents will be required to enter their payment information on the last page of the contract to save their account information. In workflows like this, parent payment information is saved on the contract but no payment is collected at the time of contract signing. For more information, please review the Autopay Setup section of the Settings: Billing Setup Page article. Billing Management Tab When a parent/payer logs into their portal, they can select Billing Management to access their Billing Management tab.

If a financial split has been set up, each parent/guardian will only see the amount that they owe, and they cannot see the split amounts that have been applied. If the account is overdue, there will be a red triangle as shown above indicating that there's an overdue balance. Next Amount Due: This is the next amount that's due and the due date. If you set a custom Autopay date for the payer, they will see their date reflected here. Otherwise, it will display the global billing day by default. Make Payment button: This button will display once the first billing statement is sent, which is 10 days before the date that the first payment is due on the global billing day. Once available, the parent can click the button to make a current payment that's due if they're not enrolled in Autopay. Good to Know When a payment is made it goes into processing. You can not reverse or make adjustments to a payment that's being processed. Once the payment has been processed, you can take action (if needed) such as setting up a refund. Manual Payments and Autopay Pop some Popcorn! If you'd like to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library. Parents can make manual payments for the current balance or any custom amount. When submitting their payment, they can save their payment method details or enter new payment details. If your school has Autopay set up, parents can also enable or disable Autopay (unless it's required) and (if you've enabled the parent-facing options) they'll have the option to change their Autopay date(s). To read more about the parent Autopay experience and see examples of what it looks like on their end, please check out this article: Billing: Managing Autopay . Once their payment has been submitted and processed, they'll receive a ' payment received ' email. If the payment fails, they'll receive a ' payment failed ' email. Both of these templates can be customized within your Billing email templates . When a parent makes a payment, they'll enter the following information: Current balance or a custom amount Payment method: They can use a saved payment method or enter new payment details. An option to enroll in Autopay if they're not already enrolled (Unless your school has disabled Autopay, in which case they will not see that option.) Here's an example of what the parent sees after selecting the Make a Payment button: Important Note for Manual Payment Reporting: Manual payments will not be assigned to the student until the next billing date. You can see the payment reflected in the payer's ledger, however, you won't see the student it was applied to until the billing date. The payment also will not be applied to the student's balance on the Billing Student List page. Admin-Entered Manual Payments Admins can also apply manual payments if a parent/guardian drops a check off at the school within the payer record. Click here to learn how. Enable/Disable Autopay *This only applies to schools that have autopay set up. Parents sometimes want to turn off Autopay if they have insufficient funds and then re-enable it with their previously saved banking credentials. If they need to, parents can enable/disable Autopay within their Billing Management Tab ( as long as your school doesn\u2019t have autopay set as required). If your school requires Autopay, please refer to the note below for detailed information on how Autopay can be disabled if needed. When a parent has Autopay set up, the Autopay details will display under their Next Amount Due section. If a change has been made to their Autopay date(s) that will also be noted along with the date of when the change will take effect. If you have Autopay set up and you've enabled Parent Facing Additional Payment Options , parents/guardians will be able to manage their Autopay date(s) along the right in the Manage AutoPay Dates section. Please note , that if you have not set Autopay options to be parent-facing , they will not see the Manage Autopay section. They will, however, still be able to enable/disable Autopay through the Update Payment Details button and they will still see their Autopay dates listed above their ledger. Please note, for Schools that require Autopay : If your school has Autopay set as required and you manually disable it for any one of your parents, Autopay can only be re-enabled for that parent if either: You re-enable it on the Admin side (by clicking the \u2018 Enable Autopay \u2019 link on the parent\u2019s Billing &gt; Overview tab .) The parent adds a new payment profile within their Billing Management tab. This new profile will give them the option to enroll in Autopay again. Notes on this process: When the parent adds a new payment method and selects to Enroll in Autopay, the selection they make is locked in ( the \u2018Enroll in Autopay\u2019 checkbox can not be unchecked ). The parent can refresh their page or click back to get out of making this selection or they can proceed to finalize enrolling in Autopay. Update Payment Details Please Note Payment profiles are tied to the portal login. If the login for a financially responsible party is changed in any way outside of editing the email address under 'Parent Portal Accounts' the connected payment profile will not be connected to the new login. Clicking on the Update Payment Details button will provide options to either update or delete account info. After selecting Update Payment Details, the payer is brought to a screen that lists all of their saved Payment Profiles and allows them to add new profiles or edit their existing one. If you are requiring Autopay, your payers will have to add a second payment profile before they can make any edits to the initial one (if they only have one payment profile to begin with). Ledger and Statements Ledger Here, payers can see their ledger of charges and credits including the date, description, and category of the fee/credit, the amount, and the remaining balance. The ledger displays a month of their past-due balances as well as some of their upcoming charges. Above the ledger, there is a Show History button. When selected, the parent's entire ledge will display. Parents can then select Show Installments to return to the abridged view. Along the ledger column headers, parents have information icons available to them. When they hover over it, they see helper text. Within the ledger: Items are listed in ascending order (oldest first). A thick black line represents the current date (anything above it is past due). Past-due items are listed in bold red. Behavior of past-due balances: Past-due balances roll over to the next month. For example, if a parent owes $50 on September 1st and doesn't pay, on October 1st, they will owe that $50 PLUS whatever other charges apply for October. Parents can expand the details link to view the breakdown of the charge per student. Monthly Statements Clicking the 'Monthly Statements' dropdown will allow the payer to select and download their statements by month within the current year or previous years. When a month is selected, the pdf of that statement will automatically be downloaded. Summary Statement Selecting 'Summary Statement' will open a PDF statement of all ledger activity up to the current month. Once open, the payer can download the pdf. * The Billing Statement (called Summary Statement here) and the Monthly Billing Statement are both located in your letter templates if you'd like to customize them or add your school's banner. Tax Statement This will open a copy of the tax statement that payers can print at any point for their records. (The tax statement is located in your letter templates if you'd like to customize it). Shared Access Shared access allows a parent or billing account holder to grant access to another individual for making one-time payments on an account. To learn about the Parent/Guardian experience with shared access, please check out this article: Shared Access: Parent/Guardian Experience Billing for Inactive Statuses IMPORTANT: Billing will still post for any students who are moved to an inactive enrollment status and have outstanding/remaining balances. Depending on your school's policy for the payer's financial responsibility for the situation, the school will need to apply a credit to all associated payer accounts for any amounts not owed. Inactive statuses include financial/academic hold, midyear withdrawal, not enrolling, and any custom inactive statuses.

    "body": "Overview Many elements of the Billing Process can be handled between the student contact record and the parent/guardian contact records. Financial responsibility and splits can be managed in the student record, whereas ledger history, adding fees, and credits are handled in the parent record. How-To: Use the Billing Tab on the Student Record When you are viewing a specific student's contact record within Finalsite Enrollment, you can access their Billing tab by clicking on it from the list of tabs at the top of the page. Please note: Your tabs may differ from what is displayed above, based on the modules you are using. Within the Billing tab in the student record, you will see a list of financially responsible parents/guardians and their percentage splits. Here, you can add additional contacts for Shared Billing access, which you can read about here . You can also click on any of the parent/guardian names to quickly jump to the Billing tab in their contact record. Notifications for Contacts with Shared Access When adding a contact with Shared Access, notifications are automatically turned on (as long as the contact has an email address associated with their account.) To disable notifications, toggle them off in the Notification column. If notifications are on, the contact will receive all billing communications. If notifications are off, the contact will receive no billing communications. The parents/guardians can not enable or disable billing communications on their end. (Only admins have the ability to toggle on/off communications for parents with shared billing access.) Read more about communications within our Billing Communications article. How-To: Use the Billing Tab on the Parent/Guardian Record On the parent's record, you can click on the 'Billing' tab which is comprised of five sub-tabs ( Overview , Ledger , Schedule , Balances , and Audits ), explained in more detail below. Overview Tab The layout of the Overview Tab varies based on whether or not you are offering Autopay as an option to families. Overview Tab for Schools Offering Autopay If your school offers Autopay to parents, the Billing Overview Tab of a payer record will look something like this: Overview Tab for Schools that have disabled Autopay If your school has disabled Autopay or a payer is not signed up for Autopay, the Overview tab will look more like this: Overview Tab Options and Info Current Balance: The current dollar amount balance for the parent you're currently viewing. Billing Day(s) or Autopay Billing Day(s): The current billing day for the parent and (optionally) change it using the drop-down menu. Change Billing Day(s) or Change Autopay Day(s): When selected, allows you to change the payer's billing days. Late Fees Disabled: If you have enabled Automatica Late Fees under Settings -- Financial -- Billing Setup , you will see the option under the Overview tab to disable Late Fees for a particular parent. You can also view a history of all individual late fee changes by clicking on ' View Changes .' Please note: You can enable or disable Automatic Late fees and their settings on your Billing Setup page. Saved Payment Profiles: D isplays information about the payer's saved payment profile (if they have one saved). Includes the option to enable or disable autopay for the individual payer. View Changes allows you to view a log of the changes made to the payer's payment profile. Please note, for Schools that require Autopay : If your school has Autopay set as required and you manually disable it for any one of your parents, Autopay can only be re-enabled for that parent if either: You re-enable it on the Admin side (by clicking the \u2018 Enable Autopay \u2019 link on the parent\u2019s Billing &gt; Overview tab.) The parent adds a new payment profile within their Billing Management tab. This new profile will give them the option to enroll in Autopay again. Notes on this process: When the parent adds a new payment method and selects to Enroll in Autopay, the selection they make is locked in ( the \u2018Enroll in Autopay\u2019 checkbox can not be unchecked ). The parent can refresh their page or click back to get out of making this selection or they can proceed to finalize enrolling in Autopay. Ledger Within the Ledger tab, you can see a record of each financial transaction and any upcoming amounts that will be due. You'll also see the payer's Billing Day(s) and Autopay Billing Day(s) listed above the ledger, as highlighted in the image below. The columns in this tab are as follows: Date: The date that a charge, credit, or payment is due or was added. Description: A brief description of the charge/credit/payment. Type/Category: The billing category of the charge/credit/payment. Amount: The amount of the charge/credit/payment. Balance: Remaining balance for the parent. On the Ledger, there will be a dotted line, as shown below, that will move up on the billing day to divide past amounts and current amounts due. Ledger Lock The Ledger Lock feature lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on or before the set date. Ledger Lock is set up on your Billing Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). Here's how the Ledger Lock feature impacts the ledger: Delete and Edit buttons are not available for payments or charges with locked dates. Adding charges, credits, or payments to the ledger is blocked for the locked dates. In the Rearrange Installments tool, you won\u2019t be able to rearrange installments for any months within the locked range. Note: The rearrange button will be available but when processing the adjustment, you\u2019ll have to select a post date outside of the locked range. Refunds and Failed Payments: If the original date is within the locked range, the refund or failed payment will be posted to the ledger with the current date instead of the original payment date. Read more about Ledger Lock and how it affects other areas of your site in our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. Ledger Tab Action Buttons Within the Ledger tab, you have access to several buttons, which include: Student and Term Filters Add a charge Add a credit Add a payment Rearrange the Installments View Monthly Statements View the Summary Statement Send the Statement Student and Term Filters The ' Student Filter ' and the ' Term Filter ' allow you to filter the ledger based on your selection. Student Filter Options: All: shows all students (default). None: shows account level fees/payments. A list of all students that the payer is responsible for. Selecting one of the student names will filter the ledger to only show that student's ledger items including all charges, credits, and payments assigned to them. Term Filter Options: All: shows all students (default). None: shows account level fees/payments. A list of all terms represented on the ledger. Filtering by a specific term will narrow the ledger results to show only the ledger items within that term. Additional notes: This is only available on the admin side, it is not parent-facing. The ledger will default to show all students/terms. When a payment is made for multiple students and you filter by one student on the ledger, the system will only show the portion of the payment associated with the student you filtered by. Add a Charge The ' Add Charge ' button allows you to add a charge or fee for which the parent/guardian is responsible. Click here to learn more about adding charges to the ledger. Add a Credit The ' Add Credit' button allows you to add a credit to the parent/guardian's account. Click here for more details on how to add credits. Add a Payment The ' Add Payment ' button allows you to add an ad-hoc payment amount or additional payment amount at any point in the billing cycle such as paper check payments, early payments (before a charge is posted), additional payments, an ad-hoc book fee, etc. Click here to learn more about how to manage manually added payments. Rearrange Installments The ' Rearrange Installments ' button allows you to edit the current contract payment plan. Click here to learn more! -- Monthly Statements, Summary Statement, and Send Statement Monthly Statements : Clicking the ' Monthly Statements ' dropdown will allow you to select and download statements by month within the current year or previous years. An example image of a Monthly Statement: Summary Statement : Selecting ' Summary Statement ' will open a PDF statement of all ledger activity up to the current month. Example GIF of a Summary Statement: Send Statement : The 'Send Statement' button can be used to send an updated statement directly to the parent/guardian via email. You will be asked to confirm this action after clicking the button. Schedule The Schedule ledger offers a way to view the ledger in a monthly and filterable format. You can filter the view by Term , Start Month , and End Month . Each month's column lists the amount owed for that month by category. The schedule will list all students separately. In addition, if there is an account-level charge (such as a late fee or an NSF fee), the ledger will also list the parent/payer in a row along with their charges by category and when they are owed. You can read more about the Schedule Ledger here . Balances Tab The Balances tab displays what's currently owed or credited in all billing categories, the students associated with each category, and the remaining balances. Audits Tab The Audits tab shows a collection of all pre-posted (future payments) AND current charges, credits, and changes that are recorded on the Ledger. This includes both automated and manual charges/payments/adjustments. Within this tab, you can see the following columns: Date: The date that the charge/credit/adjustment was made. Description: The description of the financial line item. Type/Category: The Billing Type/Category of the financial line item. Amount: The dollar amount of the charge/credit/adjustment. Created On: The date a charge/credit/adjustment was created. Created By: For all pre-posted amounts, this column will display the email address of the parent/guardian that submits the contract. Manual payments will display the email address of the payer. For any changes made to the account, this column will display the email address of the Admin who made those changes internally. A payment made via autopay will have no email address displayed. Deleted On: The date a financial line item was deleted in the Ledger. IMPORTANT: If you delete a financial line item in the 'Ledger' tab, the old line item will be removed from the ledger but will show up as a deleted item in the 'Audits' tab. If you modify a financial line item, the old item will be deleted from the Ledger and be recorded as deleted in the 'Audits' tab, and the modified financial line item will display in the 'Audits' tab and the ledger. Deleted By: The name of the user that deleted the financial line item. Did you know? You can restore a deleted ledger item by clicking the reverse icon within the Audits tab. Only manually added ledger items can be deleted, and therefore, restored. Read more about this in our How-To Reverse a Deleted Ledger Item article.

    "body": "Overview To get started with Finalsite Enrollment Billing, you'll need to define some important criteria for all of your collections and reporting. These criteria are located within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup. Who has access to this page? Types: System Admin and Admins Permissions: Financial In this article Billing Setup Revenue Recognition Late Fee Setup Ledger Lock Autopay Setup Email Notification Settings Billing Setup Within the first section of the page, labeled Billing Setup, you'll be able to set the following: Default Billing Day Additional Billing Days Multiple Autopay withdrawal days (Offer Additional Billing Day Options) Grace Period Overdue Threshold Default term for payer-level categories Default Billing Day The Default Billing Day is the date that will be initially set as the Billing Date for all payers. If no changes are made to a payer's billing day(s), this will be their billing date each month. This is a global setting which means that, when it's set, it updates the default date for all payers who do not already have a custom Billing Date set. When custom billing dates are set for payers, the global billing date does not apply to them, and updating the global date does not change that payer's billing date settings. When you adjust the Default Billing Day, you will see the following confirmation pop-up box which will ask you whether or not you'd like to email families to notify them of the change. If you opt to email families, they will be sent the Billing Day Changed email. Only the accounts that have the Default Billing Day set as their date will receive the message because changing the Default Billing Date has no impact on accounts with custom billing date(s). You can read more about that email in our Billing Communications article. Last Day Option Setting the Billing Day to \"Last Day\" will make the last day of the month the billing day. So, whether that falls on the 28th, 30th, or 31st, the Billing Day would be whatever the last day of the month is. The Billing Day drives a few important behaviors of your billing cycle: Within the contract, payment plan schedules will only reflect the Default Billing Day. Any custom billing day(s) will be reflected on the payer ledger and within billing statements. For those with Autopay enabled: Outstanding balances are charged to payers on their Autopay Day(s). If they have no custom autopay days set up, their balance will automatically be charged on the Default Billing Day. Additional Billing Days (optional) *You can only use Additional Billing Days when Autopay is enabled. Next to setting the Default Billing Day, you have the option to set Additional Billing Days. These are the options that payers can choose to change their billing date to if you have enabled the Additional Billing Days option under the Autopay Setup section ( see below ). In other words: If you want to give parents the option to change their billing date: 1. Enable the Additional Billing Days option under Parent Facing Additional Payment Options. 2. Choose the dates you would like for parents to have the option to select within the Additional Billing Days dropdown menus pictured above. Once saved, whatever dates you selected will be available for parents to select when managing their Autopay. Example: Additional Notes: You can add up to 3 additional dates for parents to choose from as their billing dates. The parent will see these options (along with the Default Billing Day) when opting to change their autopay date in their parent portal. You don't have to select dates in all 3 dropdown menus. If you just want to give the parent 1 additional option, for example, you can leave the other dropdown menus blank. For example: If changing or adding Additional Billing Days, you must select the Save button on the Billing Setup page for the changes to take effect. You, as an admin, are not limited to these options. Within a parent record, on their Billing &gt; Overview Tab, you can still select to change a payer's Billing date to any date in the month. Multiple Autopay withdrawal days (Offer Additional Billing Day Options) *You can only use Additional Billing Day Options when Autopay is enabled. This section contains two options: 2 Monthly Withdrawals 4 Monthly Withdrawals Enabling either of these options allows you to set parents up with multiple autopay withdrawals per month. Once you select an option, you must set the autopay dates by selecting them in the dropdown menus and save your change with the Save button. Please see the Important Notes section for things to keep in mind. Important Notes: Enabling these here only enables them as options on your side (parent records), i.e. it doesn't grant parents the option to make that change in their portal. To make these options parent-facing, they must be enabled under the Autopay Setup section. Read more about what enabling this for parents means within the Parent Facing Additional Payment Options section below. You must select dates that are at least 7 days apart. If you try to set dates closer than that, you will see an error message when attempting to save. If a parent opts to switch from a single autopay day to multiple autopay days after the family's first billing charge of the month has passed, the change will not take effect until the following month. For example: The Jenkins family has a single billing day each month (the 10th) and they are set up for autopay. Every month on the 10th, they are automatically charged their balance. Then, one month on the 14th, they decide to switch from single autopay to multiple autopay. Because their billing charge date (the 10th) has already passed, their new multiple autopay schedule will not take effect until the following month. Custom Billing Day Per Payer You can set a custom billing day(s) per payer within the payer record in the billing Overview tab. When set, the custom day will ignore the Default Billing Day when Autopay is processed and when ledger items are assessed to billing statements. Please refer to our Contact Record: Billing Tab article for more in-depth information regarding setting custom days for payers within their records. Grace Period The Grace Period indicates the number of days after the due date when an account is overdue. The overdue flag will not be set for billing accounts unless the threshold amount has been met or exceeded and the grace period has expired. Grace Period and Threshold Amount settings are optional. Accounts are considered overdue based on these settings only if they're configured on your site. If they are not configured, an account will be considered overdue if they have an outstanding balance after their Billing Date has passed. For those with multiple autopay days per month, the Grace period is counted after the last autopay withdrawal date of the month. If you need to apply a late fee, you can do so manually within the contact record or you may enable automatic late fee assessment within the billing setup page. Late fees are not automatically set or turned on by default. If your school would like to automate late fees, you can turn them on within the billing setup page. Read more in the Late Fee section below. Overdue Threshold The Overdue Threshold is the minimum balance amount set for an account to be considered overdue after the Billing Day, or after the Grace Period, if one is set. For those with multiple autopay withdrawal dates, the Billing Day is the last autopay withdrawal date in the month. If you hover over the \"i\" you will see the following helper text: Example: The first day after the Billing Day or the first day after the Grace Period expires, the account will be flagged as overdue as long as the overdue threshold amount has been met or exceeded. Important Notes: Overdue flag: This amount controls the overdue flag in the Billing Accounts Page and in the Payer Records. Unless the threshold has been reached, the billing accounts will not have the 'overdue' flag set. Email Notifications: The automatic overdue emails that are sent out will be turned off for a payer if their current balance is less than the overdue threshold the moment they become overdue. However, if the threshold amount has been met, the overdue email will be sent. Example: I have a balance of $5 due 11/1 and I do not pay. On 11/2 I should be overdue (if there's no grace period). However, there's an overdue threshold of $10 set, which means my account isn't yet considered overdue. I won't receive the overdue email as the payer, and my account won't have the overdue flag on the Admin side of the record or the Billing Accounts page. Next month, if I owe $105 on 12/1 ($100 for December plus the $5 I never paid in November), and I still don't pay, the amount that my account is overdue by is now $110, which is above the $10 threshold. This means my account will now be considered overdue, and I will receive the overdue email as a payer. In addition, the Billing Accounts page and the Payer record will be flagged as overdue for Admins. If enabled, this is also when an automatic late fee would be applied to the ledger. In this example, only a threshold is set up. When Grace Periods are also configured, the system first waits a set amount of time before marking an account as overdue. Default term for payer-level categories This dropdown sets the default term for payer (or account-level) categories. All auto-assigned payer-level fees (like late fees or NSF fees) will automatically have this term set for them. If you are manually adding a payer-level fee, you can select a term to apply it to. If you don't select one, it will auto-set to the term set here. Important You must update this every year. If you do not set the term here, the system defaults to your Enrollment year. That means when payer-level charges (like late fees) are posted to a ledger, the system will assign the fee to whatever term you have set as your enrollment year (unless you set the term here.) We recommend updating the term after the last autopay date for the current term has passed or when your fiscal year ends. Revenue Recognition Within the Billing tab, you have a Revenue Recognition Report to track what financial line items you booked for the year, and when you expect to receive it. In your Billing Setup page, you'll need to set some global parameters such as the start and end months and a default revenue recognition allocation rule. This will act as a default for all of your Billing Categories. However, if you need to define different recognition periods or allocation rules per billing category, you can do so within Settings &gt;Financial &gt;Billing Categories . Setting the Global Recognition Periods Revenue Recognition Start/End Month: Revenue Recognition periods are when amounts will be recognized. They can be configured with any combinations between the calendar year, January through December. You'll need to set the Revenue Recognition start and end months for your report, which will apply to all billing categories unless custom parameters have been set for individual billing categories. Default Revenue Recognition Allocation Rule: Allocation is how the amounts will be recognized and are defined as follows: At Once: This option is used most often. Upon contract submission, the full amount of the contract regardless of payment plan selection (the payment plan will be ignored) will be recognized in the report according to the month it was signed. This means the billing categories set up with this 'at once' rule will be recognized immediately. If any billing categories have different parameters, they will be recognized accordingly. * Exception: If the contract is submitted outside of the recognition period, it will post at the start month of the next recognition period. Important Note about ad-hoc fees: If you add an ad-hoc fee in July, but you set the recognition parameters to a later period such as October-November, then any ad-hoc fees that were applied from July through October would be displayed starting in October. This means October will display the ad-hoc fees for July, August, September, and October, and then anything applied in November will display in November as expected. Equal Spread: When a contract is submitted, the Billing Categories set with this rule will be recognized evenly across the number of months set by the recognition period you set, even if the payment is set to be collected in a month outside of the revenue recognition start/end month. *It will continue into the following year to equally spread until that amount has been totaled. These same rules apply if the contract is submitted outside of the recognition period with the 'At Once' rule. Example: If you're not collecting revenue until July, but you set the parameters to June, the revenue will be recognized starting in June (despite this money not technically being paid yet). The same is true if you have a 3-month payment plan set for July, August, and September. If you set the parameters to only July and August (and therefore ignoring September), the full amount will be recognized between these 2 months even though it hasn't been collected for September yet. Spread with Catchup: When a contract is submitted, the Billing Categories set up with this rule will be recognized evenly across the number of months set up by the recognition period, which includes a 'catchup' if the contract is submitted after the start month and before the end month. In this case, the first month will have a lump sum of the previous months, then the remaining amount will be spread evenly across the remaining months. Example: March - December is the recognition period, but the payment plan doesn't start until July. The plan runs until June of next year for a 12-month payment plan. The contract was submitted in July. We're starting to recognize the revenue in March across a 10th-month plan. So if we had $1200 spread across 12 months, $300 would be recognized in March and $100 would be recognized in each month thereafter. Important Note about Variable Recognition Periods: If there's a different recognition period for different ad-hoc fees for example or any individual billing categories within a grouping, then you'll need to create a new billing category group for those fees so that you can set a unique recognition period for them. Late Fee Setup Late Fees for billing accounts are not automatically set or turned on by default. If your school would like to automate late fees, you can turn them on within the billing setup page. Reminders Late fees will be applied according to the grace period and/or overdue threshold amount if either is set. In addition, once enabled, late fees will only apply moving forward, they will not be added to any amount that was considered overdue before enabling Automatic Late Fees within your site. For those with multiple autopay withdrawal dates per month, the Billing Day is considered the last autopay withdrawal date of the month. Therefore, the system processes Late Fees based on that day with consideration of whatever Grace period and Threshold you may have set. Automatic Late Fees: Within the Late Fee Setup section, you can check the box to automatically apply late fees If you hover over the \"i\" you will see additional information. Automatic Late fee charges are recurring, meaning they will continue to be charged every month that the account remains overdue. Late fees can be disabled on an individual basis within the Overview tab of the billing account record. Late Fee Amount: You can set a custom amount for all late fees. You can set late fee amounts as a flat rate, a percentage, or both a flat rate and a percentage. For example, if you'd like to set a flat $10 charge plus a 1% charge for all overdue accounts, this can be supported by adding both a flat 'Late Fee Amount' and a 'Late Fee by Percentage'. If you opt to charge both a flat rate and a percentage, the system will first calculate the percentage and then add the flat rate on top of that. Late Fee Billing Category: You MUST have a Parent Fees Billing Category setup within your Settings &gt;Financial &gt;Billing Categories page. This billing category must have the \"apply to student balance\" option unchecked . A couple of additional notes: Remember to save your changes by clicking the ' Save ' button near the bottom of the page. Late fees are applied according to the grace period and/or overdue threshold amount if either of these is set. When applicable, Late Fees are only charged once per month (even for accounts set up with multiple Autopay dates). You will also have the option to select ' View Changes ' next to the Automatic Late Fees checkbox, which will give you an audit log of the adjustments to this setting. Parent Fees Billing Category When setting up late fees, you must have a Parent Fees billing category setup within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories page. This billing category must have the \"apply to student balance\" option unchecked as displayed in the example below. Ledger Lock The Ledger Lock lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on before the set date. For example, if you set the Ledger Lock to 11/1/2025, no ledger items can be added or changed on 11/1/2025 and all dates prior to that. Here's a list of what the Ledger Lock impacts: Ledger Delete and Edit buttons are not available for payments or charges with locked dates. Adding charges, credits, or payments to the ledger is blocked for the locked dates. In the Rearrange Installments tool, you won\u2019t be able to rearrange installments for any months within the locked range. Note: The rearrange button will be available but when processing the adjustment, you\u2019ll have to select a post date outside of the locked range. Contract Submission (pay at once payment plans): If a contract is submitted during the locked time frame, ledger items will post starting on the 1st billing date after the locked period. For example: The c urrent date in this example: 08/01/2024 and Ledger Lock date: 10/1/2024 A contract is submitted on the current date (which is in the locked period), here's what to expect: Only payment plans that don't have dates within the locked range will appear as options. If selecting a pay-at-once option, the charge will post as due on the 1st billing date after the ledger lock period, which, in this example would be 11/1/2024. Payment Plans If a payment plan includes a locked month, the plan will not show up as an option on contracts. In addition, a flag will appear on the payment plans page in the Has Schedule column to let you know that the plan will not appear on contracts due to locked dates. Flagged plans can still be edited. The payment plans setup page is found under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payment Plans . Refunds and Failed Payments Refunds : If the original date is within the locked range, the refund will be posted to the ledger with the current date listed instead of the original payment date. Failed Payments: If the original date is within the locked range, both the Chargeback and NSF fee will be posted to the ledger with the current date listed instead of the original payment date. Billing Reports You are blocked from adding charges or credits in the locked period in the Accounts , Students , and AR Aging reports . Autopay Setup and Parent-Facing Options Autopay is an option that enables automatic withdrawals for payers. Within the Autopay setup section, you can enable, require, or disable Autopay. In addition, you can set how much autonomy you'd like to give to payers for changing and enabling different autopay options in their Parent Portal. Read on to learn more. Autopay Setup Retry Failed Autopay Payments: Enabling this allows the system to re-attempt to charge most failed payments. In other words, if a payer has autopay enabled and their payment fails, the system will retry charging them one more time. You can read more about this feature in our Retry Failed Autopay Payments article. Preselect Autopay Checkbox: Enabling this setting requires users to specifically opt out of autopay when making a payment. Disabling this setting requires users to manually opt-in to autopay by clicking the checkbox when making a payment. Users who have already selected an autopay status will not be affected. Require Autopay: Enabling this setting will require payers to enroll in autopay when making a payment. It will also turn on autopay for anyone who has saved a payment method in their account. Require Autopay for $0 Deposits: Enabling this setting requires users to enroll in Autopay, even if their contract has no deposit or other fees collected at signing. Please note that to save this selection, you need to have Autopay enabled. If you try to save it without Autopay, you'll see an error message. A Few additional notes on this feature: When the contract is submitted by a parent, the payment screen will show a message at the top, stating: AutoPay enrollment is required by {Your School Name}. Please select a payment method and set up AutoPay for future installments. This payment screen will show up, even if there's no deposit required, but no payment will be actually processed in this case. The page will only serve to save the parent's autopay details. Here is an example of what the messaging on the Payment screen looks like. Please note that a blue box has been added to the image to highlight the text area. Disable Autopay: Enabling this setting will remove the ability for a payer to enroll in autopay. It will also turn off autopay for anyone who currently has autopay enabled. To enable one of these settings, check the box and click Save at the bottom of the page. A window will pop up asking you to confirm your choice. Please note, for Schools that require Autopay : If your school has Autopay set as required and you manually disable it for any one of your parents, Autopay can only be re-enabled for that parent if either: You re-enable it on the Admin side (by clicking the \u2018 Enable Autopay \u2019 link on the parent\u2019s Billing &gt; Overview tab.) Or, the parent adds a new payment profile within their Billing Management tab. This new profile will give them the option to enroll in Autopay again. Notes on this process: When the parent adds a new payment method and selects to Enroll in Autopay, the selection they make is locked in ( the \u2018Enroll in Autopay\u2019 checkbox can not be unchecked ). The parent can refresh their page or click back to get out of making this selection or they can proceed to finalize enrolling in Autopay. Parent Facing Additional Payment Options The Parent Facing Additional Payment Options allow you to enable autopay processing options for parents to choose on their end, within the Parent Portal. Autopay must be enabled to utilize any of these options. Additional Billing Days: When this is enabled, payers can select their own Billing Date. The options payers have on their end are determined by the dates you have selected in the Billing Setup Section. For example, If this is your setup: Parents would see this in their parent portal (Billing Management tab) 2 Monthly Withdrawals and 4 Monthly Withdrawals : When enabled, Payers can select to have autopay withdrawn twice a month (2 Monthly Withdrawals) or four times a month (4 Monthly Withdrawals). Payers can not choose the dates of the withdrawals on their end. The dates you set within the Billing Setup section are the dates that parents see when making their selections. Example using 2 Monthly Withdrawals. Parents would see this in their parent portal (Billing Management tab) Keep in Mind Remember to save your changes by clicking Save anytime you adjust these settings. When none of these parent-facing options are enabled, the payer will not see the Manage Autopay section on their end. They will still see their Autopay dates listed but they will not have the option to make any changes on their end. Parent view with one or more parent-facing options enabled (note the Manage Autopay section) Parent view when none of the parent-facing options are enabled (note the Manage Autopay section is no longer there but the Autopay dates are still displayed) Additional notes regarding Autopay: Regardless of these settings, you can turn autopay on or off for individual payers within the Overview tab of the payer's contact record at any time. To see these options, click on an account you want to change and click on their Billing submenu. If that payer has a saved payment method on their account, you can turn on autopay for that account. If they do not have a saved payment method, they won\u2019t have autopay enabled, but it will force them to enroll the next time they make a payment. Clicking on \u2018 View Changes \u2019 for either of these two settings will pull up an audit history, showing you exactly when the setting was activated or deactivated, and by which user on your site as shown below. Email Notification Settings Within Settings &gt; Communications &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing , you have a list of automated and customizable emails that are sent based upon different triggers in the Billing workflow. You can customize the timing of these emails, disable them, and/or send additional email notifications for the Upcoming Statement and the Account Overdue email. There's a link to these Billing email templates within the description as displayed below. Email Notification Descriptions Each of these emails, except for the Account Overdue email, can be disabled or have a custom number of days set for their delivery. Once you customize the frequency of each email notification you would like to send, click Save at the bottom of the page to set your changes. Best Practice: For the second and third notice emails, edit the subject line of the email to indicate whether it's the second or third notice. You can edit the emails within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails. Upcoming Statement: The system default is to send the Upcoming Statement email 10 days before the Billing Date that's set within this page, or according to a custom billing date if one is set. However, you can customize the timing of this email to be sent sooner or later, as preferred. Upcoming Statement - Second Notice: This is a 2nd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their payment is approaching. This is also sent according to the global billing date or an individual billing date if one is set. Upcoming Statement - Third Notice: This is a 3rd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their payment is approaching. This is also sent according to the global billing date or an individual billing date if one is set. Account Overdue: This email is sent 1 day after the billing day if no grace period is set. If there's no grace period, the frequency will say \"0 days after billing date (grace period).\" In the screenshot above, there's a 3-day grace period set, so the Account Overdue email will be sent 3 days after the billing date. Account Overdue - Second Notice: This is a 2nd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their account is overdue. Account Overdue - Third Notice: This is a 3rd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their account is overdue. The Cycle of Notification Emails Email Notification Parameters When setting up the schedule for your billing email notifications, please keep in mind the following parameters. Error message: Upcoming Statement and Account Overdue notifications can't overlap. The notifications are designed so that the Statement emails are sent before the Billing Date and Account Overdue emails after the Billing Date. The cycle refreshes every month. If you schedule an overdue email to overlap with the upcoming month's schedule, you'll receive this error. For example: In this image, the Account Overdue - Third Notice is slated to go out on the 20th of the month (15 days after the billing day + 5-day grace period) while the Upcoming Statement email would be sent on the 15th. The third overdue email overlaps with the previous month's schedule. This is not allowed by the system. Illustration of the overlapping notification schedule described above. Error Message(s): Upcoming Statement - Second Notice must be after \"Upcoming Statement\" Upcoming Statement - Third Notice must be after \"Upcoming Statement - Second Notice\" Account Overdue - Second Notice must be after \"Account Overdue\" Account Overdue - Third Notice must be after \"Account Overdue - Second Notice \" You can not set any of the notifications for Overdue and Statement emails to be sent before the preceding one. You must set the Statement emails in descending order. For example: You must set the Overdue emails in ascending order. For example: Error Message: Upcoming Statement must be greater than 2. The first Upcoming Statement email must be set to go out more than 2 days before the Billing Date. If you try to set it to either 1 or 2, the system will throw this error. This is because of the automated Upcoming Payment email the system sends out 2 days before the payment is due.

    "body": "Tuition Assistance / Financial Aid The preferred method for capturing and presenting Tuition Assistance is on the contract. However, there are a few potential issues with this: Tuition Assistance awarded weeks or month after the contract is issued and signed Tuition Assistance that is awarded on a per parent basis rather than on a per Student basis, particularly within the context of split households. Options Based on Different Processes Tuition Assistance on a per-student basis &amp; awards are made before contract issuing. If the Tuition Assistance is awarded on a per-student basis before the contract being sent out, the easiest way to add financial aid to students is to use the built-in fields to display the award on the contract. The payment plans will calculate off the net balance after the award. Check out our Financial Aid Management article to learn how to add aid to a student. Tuition Assistance on a per-student basis &amp; awards are made after issuing the contract. If the Tuition Assistance is awarded after contracts are generally issued, there are several options available. Which option you choose depends on your school\u2019s process and timeline. Option 1: Use an intent to enroll form and issue the contract once Tuition Assistance has been awarded. Option 2 : Issue the contract, have the parent/guardian sign, and then re-issue an updated contract once the award has been made. This process works well as long as the awards are made and the contracts are due back prior to the start of any payment plans. The downside is having the parent go through the contract process twice, especially with multiple signatures. However, the contract will save previously submitted answers so generally it should be quicker to sign. It may increase the need to follow-up with parents if they don\u2019t realize they need to re-sign the updated agreement. Option 3: Manually apply the award to the parent\u2019s billing account. The award will not be reflected on the contract. Tuition Assistance on a Per-Parent Basis (Finalsite Enrollment Billing) For Schools that use Finalsite Enrollment Billing: If you'd like to assign aid on a per-parent basis, we recommend utilizing the Split Contracts feature. Please check out our Billing: Split Contracts article to learn about this in depth.",

    "body": "Glossary Billing Account Financially responsible account for tuition and incidental fees. Billing accounts are attached to contact records within the system and are linked to portal user accounts so parents/guardians can sign contracts, view billing history, pay balances, and manage Autopay settings. Billing Day The day of the month that the account balance is due. For accounts, with a single billing day, that day of the month is when their balance is due. For accounts that have multiple autopay days per month, the last autopay day of the month is considered the account's Billing Day. AutoPay The feature that enables automatic drafts from billing accounts each month. Read more about Autopay in our Billing: Managing Autopay article.

Balance The current total amount of money owed to the school by the billing account. Overdue Balance The current past due amount owed by the billing account. Financial Split The percentage of responsibility for the billing account for a student. This is set on a per-student basis, enabling flexible household relationships. There is a limit of 4 financially responsible accounts for a given student. Click here to learn more. Financial Responsibility Financial responsibility is a yes/no toggle setting within the Parent Portal Access tab of a student record. It allows parents/guardians access to the contract. It can be used by admins to send emails to financially responsible parties or export this information as part of student data. A parent/guardian that has financial responsibility disabled will still see the contract checklist item listed, however, they will not be able to access and sign the contract as there will be no 'complete form' button that displays, and no printable PDF to view once it's been submitted by a financially responsible parent or guardian.

Click here to learn more. Billing Ledger Items Ledger items comprise of charges, credits, and payments. They contain metadata regarding the date posted, amount, billing category type, associated student, and school year. Charge An amount applied to the billing ledger that is owed by the billing account. Credit An amount applied to the billing ledger that is credited to the billing account. Payment A posted payment. Payments can be split across students and billing category balances. Billing Account Ledger The billing account ledger is a historical record of ledger items that are comprised of charges, credits, and payments for that parent\u2019s account. Billing Categories Balance Billing accounts maintain a sub-balance for each student's billing, split by billing category and school year. For example, a billing account maintains a sub-balance for categories like Tuition, General fees, or any other custom billing category.",

The Billing Date can be a global date, or a custom date (set on an individual account's record. You can read more about the Billing Day within our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. For those with multiple Autopay enabled, the Billing Date will be the last Autopay date of the month. For more info on multiple Autopay, please refer to our Billing: Managing Autopay article. 10 days before the Billing Date, the system will: If the billing account has a balance, the system will send an upcoming statement notification email to the billing account contact. IMPORTANT NOTE FOR THOSE WITH MULTIPLE AUTOPAY If the payer's 1st autopay date of the month is less than 10 days after their last autopay date of the previous month, this email (Upcoming Statement) will be sent the day after the payer's last autopay date rather than 10 days before their 1st autopay date of the next month . If autopay is not on , it will maintain its previous behavior, sending it 10 days before the billing date. Additional Notes Sending this email at the 10-day mark is how the system sets it by default, however, you can adjust the timing of this as well as other Upcoming Statement notification emails within your Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup page.

    "body": "Overview Providing Autopay is a valuable time-saving feature for parents and schools. It reduces the burden of managing account receivables and speeds payment times for schools. For parents, it is easier than having to remember to manually pay a bill each month. By providing an Autopay option, there are additional compliance issues that need to be considered. Autopay can be required for all billing accounts or disabled within your Billing Setup page. Click here to learn more. Guidelines Obtain authorization During the ACH enrollment process, there is authorization built to link the bank account to the school's account for recurring payments. Good to know: ACH Payments can take 5-7 days to process. There is a terms of service notice that's customizable when enrolling in Autopay, which is described in more detail below. We recommend that your contract provides relevant language to the ongoing processing of recurring payments. Provide a terms of service Finalsite Enrollment provides a customizable template, Autopay Terms and Conditions, which is located within Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Parent Portal Templates . The terms of service should include information on how a charge is defined, how to update or terminate Autopay information, liability waiver, among other service terms. Provide notice of upcoming payments Here's a breakdown of some of the automated Billing communications. These communications contain information related to the payer's autopay schedule and dates. Upcoming Payment: Two days before a payment is processed, the Upcoming Payment email is sent. Billing Day Changed: Sent immediately if you change a payer's Billing Day within the billing overview tab of their record. Upcoming Statement: Sent 10 days before a payer's billing date by default.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment Billing is built with the flexibility to support many custodial scenarios. The Financial Split percentages, which are found within the Parent Portal Access tab of a student's record, designate how much each parent or guardian will be responsible for when paying a student's contract fees. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types : System Admin, Admin, and User Permissions: Financial Permission In this article Definitions Financial Split Setup Managing the Financial Split Important notes regarding managing the Financial Split Financial Split and Ledger Behavior How to manage common ledger adjustments after adjusting the financial split Exporting Financial Split Data FAQs Pop some Popcorn! If you'd like to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library. Definitions Financial Responsibility: Parents and Guardians are automatically assigned as financially responsible for their students. Parents with this assignment can access and sign contracts. Admins can then send emails to financially responsible parties or export this information as part of student data. Turning this feature off will prevent the parent or guardian from accessing an un-submitted or fully submitted contract. You can read more in our Financial Responsibility article, here. Financial Split: The percentage financial split dictates the amount of contract tuition and fees that each parent/guardian is responsible for. Parents and Guardians can have custom financial split percentages set on a per-student basis. For example, this is useful when one parent might be 50% responsible for one student, but 100% responsible for another student. Financial Split Setup The financial split setting is located within a student's record on their Parent Portal Access tab. You can navigate there by clicking the Portal Accounts icon. By default, all parents/guardians are initially assigned a 0% Financial Split. Percentages can be defined before or after a contract is signed. If no split is defined before the contract is signed, the system automatically assigns 100% responsibility to the person paying the deposit. You can still update the percentage of the financial split after it has been assigned. The percentage of the financial split is defined on a per-student basis. This provides the ability to have mixed responsibilities within a household. Example scenarios: 100% responsibility by one parent or guardian. Responsibility is split between multiple parents or guardians. Different responsibility percentages for siblings within the same household. For example: Sibling A: Two guardians are assigned 50% of the financial split. Sibling B: One parent is designated with 100% of the financial split. Managing the Financial Split You can update the percentage of financial split assigned to a parent or guardian at any time by clicking directly on the percentage. Selecting the percentage amount will open the Edit Financial Splits dialogue box. Within the box, you will be able to edit the percentages and toggle back to previous years to edit or view the percentages in previous terms. If a parent/guardian just wants to make occasional payments, they can be set to have Shared Access which would allow them to occasionally login and submit payments for the student. Shared Access parents/guardians do not need to have any percentage of the financial split assigned to them. You can read more about how to set up a contact to have shared access here. Important notes regarding managing the Financial Split Financial Split needs to be updated on a per-student basis. If there are multiple students in the household, you'll need to update the split percentages individually for each student. Financial Split is carried forward year-to-year by default, however, they can be updated on a per-year basis. This is useful if the percentage of responsibility has changed between years. Financial Split and Ledger Behavior Whether the percentage of the financial split is assigned before the contract is submitted, with the submission of the contract, or at a later date, the ledger will populate all future charges tied to the contract on the ledger of the parent(s)/guardian(s) set with a percentage. Essentially, this means that the ledger will populate the contract charges based on the percentages. If you assign 100% to another parent/guardian, all of the future contract charges will move to the new payer's ledger. If you split the percentage between parents/guardians, the system will divide the future contract charges based on the percentage that each payer owes and update each ledger accordingly. Important: Assigning a split percentage will not retroactively edit any posted charges to that parent's account . Only future charges tied to the student's contract will move based on your adjustment. This means no manually added charges, past contract charges, or payments will be split. In other words, the following never move or change based on changes to the percentage of the financial split after contract submission : Manually added charges Payments Contract charges owed in the past The deposit charge The only thing that moves/changes based on updating the percentage of the financial split are contract charges that are owed in the future. How to manage common ledger adjustments after adjusting the financial split Scenario 1 Scenario 2 Scenario 3 Scenario 4 You need to reassign the percentage of the financial split and you don't need to move over any past contract charges, you only need to move over the remaining future contract charges that are owed. Step 1: Simply change the percentage of the financial split within the student's record and the future charges will automatically move/update within the payer(s) ledgers. You have changed the financial split but your manually added charges did not move and you'd like to move them to another parent/guardian's ledger. Step 1: On the ledger you are adding the charge(s) to, use the Add Charge button to manually add the charge to the ledger, taking care to copy the correct billing category and date the charge should be owed. Step 2: Delete the charge from the original ledger (red delete trashcan). Please note: If you do not wish to delete the manual charge, you may opt instead to add a negative charge to the ledger. Reversing the charge allows you to leave an audit trail within the ledger itself. You can read more about manually adding charges and reversing them within our Billing: Add Charge article. You are changing the financial split after some of the contract charges have been due (but no payments have been made) and you need to move the past charges to the other parent/guardian's ledger. OR You've changed the financial split so that the other parent/payer is 100% responsible and all of the contract charges moved over but the deposit did not. The deposit has not been paid and you need to move it to the other parent/guardian's ledger . You want to move all contract charges, including the deposit. Reminder regarding the deposit : These steps do not divide the deposit. It will reassign the deposit based on your change of financial percentage, but, it will not divide the deposit. For example, if you are assigning a 50/50 split, the tuition, and fees tied to the contract will be divided evenly among the payers, however, the deposit will not be divided. Important: Update the percentage of the financial split before adjusting the contract. Essentially, all you are going to do here is resubmit the contract. (Download the contract &gt; Uncheck the contract checklist item &gt; Recheck the checklist item &gt; Upload the contract that you downloaded). We have these steps written out in great detail within our Billing: How to Make Changes to Past Charges/Payment Plans with Contract Regeneration article. Please check that out to learn about this option. The deposit has already been paid and you wish to move all contract charges, including the deposit to another parent/guardian. Step 1: Uncheck the Deposit checklist item. Step 2: Change the percentage of the financial split. Step 3: Download the submitted contract. Step 4: Uncheck the contract checklist item. Step 5: Re-check the contract checklist item as complete and answer questions for submission date and payment plan options. Step 6: Upload the previous contract to the checklist item. Step 7: Recheck the Deposit checklist item, entering the amount paid and other required details to ensure the payment is recorded. Please note : If the deposit has been paid in the Billing Module, rather than directly on the contract, the payment will not be removed from the initial ledger when you uncheck the deposit checklist item. In this case, you would need to manually reverse the payment on the original ledger. You can still mark the payment in Step 7 by checking the deposit checklist item as complete, but you must manually reverse the payment on the original ledger to rectify the reporting. This is what a payment made from the Billling module (not via the contract) will look like on the ledger) Exporting Financial Split Data To view a list of all of the financial split percentages for your enrolled students: Navigate to Search &amp; Reports &gt; Search Create a search for all 'Enrolled' students From the Export menu, select Export as a Billing import template The resulting export will contain a column titled BILLING_ACCOUNT.split , this column will list the percentage of the financial split that is assigned to each contact's parents/guardians. FAQs When changing the financial split after contract submission, what happens to the deposit charge? The deposit will not move based on a change to the financial split post-contract submission. If you change the financial split after the contract has been submitted, the deposit will remain on the parent/payer that was originally set with financial responsibility. When is the financial split automatically assigned by the system? The financial split can be defined before or after a contract is signed. If no split is defined before the contract is signed, the system automatically assigns 100% responsibility to the person paying the deposit. This can be updated later by an Admin. Can a parent/payer change their financial split percentages within their Billing Management tab? No, only System Admins, Admins, and Users with Financial Permissions enabled can change the financial split percentages within the Parent Portal Access tab of the student\u2019s record. Can I change the financial split percentages after contract submission? Yes. Admins can set or change financial split percentages within the Parent Portal Access tab of the student\u2019s record at any time. Once the split percentages have been adjusted, all ledgers will update automatically. Parents cannot make these adjustments within the Parent Portal and they do not receive any automated communications that these changes have been made. Please note : Only contract tuition and fee charges due in the future will move when the financial split is changed. To learn more about moving over past charges when adjusting financial split, read above, Scenario 3 . Can I set the financial split percentages on parents/guardians before the contract submission? Yes. We recommend setting any known financial split percentages before contract submission. Can you search on the financial split percentages of parents/guardians? No, however, you can export a search for all of your enrolled students as a billing import template to see this data. See above within the Exporting Financial Split Data section. If the financial split is set before contract signing, what happens if a parent with a financial split of 0% submits the contract? Will the system automatically assign a financial split to this parent upon contract submission? No, all financial split percentages and financial responsibility settings will remain the same. Once financial split percentages are set, they will not automatically change, even if the contract is resubmitted or a different payer submits the contract the following year. The only way to change financial responsibility and financial splits once they\u2019ve been set is for an Admin to manually adjust these settings on the Parent Portal Access tab of the student\u2019s record. Parents cannot make these changes within the Parent Portal. What happens to the ledger if the financial split is changed and then the contract is re-submitted internally? The ledger populates charges based on the financial split assigned. If the contract is resubmitted after the financial split is changed, the ledger will populate all contract tuition and fees based on the split that was assigned before resubmission.

    "body": "Overview During the billing process, it's important to communicate with your families about upcoming, current, and past-due payments for timely collections. To drive this process and save time on your end, there are two types of automated communications: System automated emails that are sent by default during key points in the billing lifecycle. Optional automated reminder emails to nurture the collections process further. Let's learn more about what these templates are, when they're sent, and how to customize them for your process! Billing Communication Setup To get started with your billing communication workflows, you'll need to know what emails are sent by default, what emails can be turned on or off, and where your billing templates are located for customization and branding. The Billing Setup page , located within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup is where you can customize the timing of your Upcoming Statement and Account Overdue emails. You also have the option to turn on a second or third notice for each email type, as shown below. Communication Templates Overview The billing communication workflow includes a series of email templates and letter templates. Billing Emails are located within Settings &gt;Communications &gt;Email Templates &gt;Billing. The system sends These emails automatically during different points of the billing process and should be customized with signatures, images, etc. Please refer to the Billing Setup page for delivery customization to your Upcoming Statement and Account Overdue emails. Billing Letter Templates are located within Settings &gt;Communications &gt;Letter Templates . These include the Billing Statement and the Tax Statement. The Billing Statement is hyperlinked within many of the billing emails mentioned above and the Tax Statement is available to billing accounts within the Parent Portal. Along the right you can edit each template to customize the content, and you can revert to system default at any point to start over with our system default template. Billing Communication Workflow There's a series of system-automated emails that are sent at key points of the billing lifecycle as shown in the workflow below. Please Note This does not include the optional 2nd and 3rd upcoming Upcoming Statement and Account Overdue emails. These can be turned on/off and customized within your Billing Setup page. The Upcoming Statement email by default goes out 10 days before the Billing Date, however, you can customize that timing within the Billing Setup page. For payers with Multiple Autopay dates, please also note the following: If the payer's 1st autopay date of the month is less than 10 days away from their last autopay date of the month, the Upcoming Statement email will be sent the day after their last autopay date of the month rather than 10 days before the billing date. The Upcoming Payment email is sent 2 days before each of the payer's Autopay dates. Quick Vocab Note Billing Date: The Billing Date is the date that the account balance is due each month. The Billing Date can be a global date, or a custom date (set on an individual account's record. You can read more about the Billing Day within our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. For those with multiple Autopay enabled, the Billing Date will be the last Autopay date of the month. For more info on multiple Autopay, please refer to our Billing: Managing Autopay article. Billing Email Templates Overview and Best Practices Below is a list of automated email templates that are sent during the billing process, as well as email templates that can be sent manually or optionally. A few best practices for customizing your email templates include: Add your school banner, logo, or any other images that you're using across all or most email templates. Customize and personalize the body of the email, the signature with billing contact information, and any important links. For all 2nd and 3rd Notice email templates, we recommend editing the subject line to indicate that the payer is receiving a 2nd or 3rd notice, respectively. Please note, that the Billing Statement that's linked in the email templates is a letter template that's located within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Letter Templates &gt; Billing Statement. IMPORTANT Note about Upcoming Statement and Account Overdue Emails: You can customize the frequency and/or disable the upcoming payment and account overdue emails within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup . Billing Email Template Descriptions Billing emails can be edited Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails. Please note: If enabled, the following emails will be sent whether the parent/payer owes a balance for the month OR has a credit balance. In other words, if a payer owes a balance of $100 they would receive these emails OR if a parent/payer has a negative balance (credit balance) - $100, they would also receive these emails. Upcoming Payment Upcoming Statement Upcoming Statement - Second Notice Upcoming Statement - Third Notice Account Overdue This email is sent immediately once the payment amount is overdue, which is determined by the grace period and overdue threshold being met or exceeded. It also instructs the parent/guardian making the payment to return to the parent portal or contact the school. *Includes a link to the Billing Statement. (You can customize the Billing Statement in your letter templates as mentioned above). The Account Overdue email will be sent automatically each month that the account remains overdue. IMPORTANT: When an account has multiple Autopay dates, the system designates the last autopay day of the month as the Billing Day. Consequently, if the account remains unpaid after this date, provided that both the grace period and threshold requirements are met, an overdue email will be sent to the account. Note About Unpaid Deposit If your school has a paper check option that's chosen by the parent and they do not submit the check by the billing day, or if an Admin hasn't recorded the payment within the payer's record, this email will still go out for an unpaid deposit. The deposit charge will be added to the ledger with the associated date. On the billing date, it will attempt to auto-withdraw if set up. If no payment is made by the grace period (if one is set), then this email will go out. Account Overdue - Second Notice This is a 2nd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their account is overdue. Best Practice: Edit the subject line of the email template to indicate that this is a second notice. *Customization is available on the Billing Setup page. Account Overdue - Third Notice This is a 3rd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their account is overdue. Best Practice: Edit the subject line of the email template to indicate that this is a third notice. *Customization is available on the Billing Setup page. Auto Payment Failure Retry If you have Retry Failed Autopay Payments enabled on the Billing Setup page, this email is sent immediately whenever an Autopay payer's payment fails (so long as it fails due to an accepted reason - check out our article on this, linked below, for more insight on this). The email informs them of the payment failure and lets them know that the charge will be re-attempted. The message also contains the date that the autopay will be re-attempted on. You can read more about this feature in our Retry Failed Autopay Payments article. Billing Day Changed This email will be sent automatically if you change the individual billing date for a payer within the Overview tab in the parent/payer record. To read more about this tab, please refer to our Billing Setup article. The contents of this email can be adjusted on the Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails page. If a change is made to the global billing day within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup , you'll have the option to send this email to all billing accounts that the update has affected. When you make a change to the Default Billing Date on that page ( Billing Setup ), you will be asked in a pop-up message whether or not you'd like the system to send the Billing Day changed email to the affected payers (anyone with the Default Billing Day as their Billing Date.) Default Billing Day in the Billing Setup page Pop-Up Offering Notification Payment Failure This email goes out immediately to the parent/guardian making the payment if their payment method fails. It instructs them to return to the parent portal or contact the school. Payment Received This email is sent immediately to the payer to confirm receipt of a successful payment. The content of both the Payment Failure and Payment Received emails can be adjusted under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails. Rate Change This email is automatically sent to the affected parents who have autopay enabled when you update the rates for Credit Card or Electronic Fees that you are passing along them. Once you click Save after updating the rate on either the Credit Card or Electronic Check page, you'll see a confirmation pop-up box. If you click Confirm in that box, the rate will be updated and the email will automatically be sent to affected parents who have autopay enabled when you update the rates for Credit Card or Electronic Fees that you are passing along to parents. It's sent based on what you update and is only sent to active, applicable parents with autopay enabled. Only parents with autopay enabled who either have an upcoming charge or an unpaid past charge that will be pulled in the next autopay cycle will be emailed. For example: If you update the Credit Card convenience fee, only active parents with a Credit Card saved to autopay will be emailed. If you cancel the confirmation, the rate will not be updated and the email will not be sent. It can be updated in the Billing Email templates page: Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails Statement Updated This email is not automated and is only sent manually if the Admin clicks on the ' send statement ' button in a parent/payer record. If charges or fees are changed, the Admin should click on the Send statement button to notify the parent/payer of any account changes. This email informs the payer that their billing statement has been updated to reflect recent changes with a link to the updated statement. Upcoming Auto Payment If you are utilizing the multiple autopay feature, this email is sent 2 days before a payer\u2019s autopay prepay dates. As a reminder, the \"autopay prepay dates\" are all of the Autopay Dates before the Billing Date. For example, if a payer\u2019s autopay dates are the 8th, 15th, and 22nd: the 8th and the 15th are considered their \"autopay prepay dates\" and the 22nd is considered their \"billing date\". This payer will automatically receive the Upcoming Auto Payment email on the 6th and 13th, and then, two days before their final billing day of the month (the 20th in this example), the payer would receive the Upcoming Payment email. The timing of the email can not be altered. Upcoming Payment This email goes out 2 days before the payment is due according to the account's Billing Day if one is set within the payer's record. It includes the upcoming charge amount and due date. This email includes a link to the Billing Statement. If the account has multiple autopay dates, the upcoming payment email send date will be based on the last autopay date in the month. For example, if the payer is set up for autopay to draft on the 1st, 15th, and 25th of each month, their Upcoming Payment email will go out 2 days before the 25th. Upcoming Statement By default, this email goes out 10 days before the payment is due according to the account's Billing Day. It includes the upcoming amounts and any overdue amounts with the due date. If Autopay is enabled for an account, this email is sent based on the account's first Autopay date of the month. Important: If the payer's 1st autopay date of the current month is less than 10 days away from their last autopay date of the upcoming month, the Upcoming Statement email will be sent the day after their last autopay date of the month rather than 10 days before the billing date. You can change the timing of when this email is sent within the Billing Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). Upcoming Statement - Second Notice This is a 2nd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their payment is approaching. This is also sent according to the global billing date or an individual billing date if one is set. Best Practice: Edit the subject line of the email template to indicate that this is a second notice. *Customization is available on the Billing Setup page. Upcoming Statement - Third Notice This is a 3rd email notification that will be sent to notify the parent/payer that their payment is approaching. This is also sent according to the global billing date or an individual billing date if one is set. Best Practice: Edit the subject line of the email template to indicate that this is a third notice. *Customization is available on the Billing Setup page. Billing Specific Merge Fields Billing templates have a merge field category called statement for all billing-related tokens such as the current balance, due date, a link to the billing statement, etc. IMPORTANT: These merge tokens ONLY work in the automated Billing email templates and will not work in any custom email templates sent manually or tied to an automated communication plan (PRO feature). For more details about Billing Merge Tokens, check out our Billing Merge Fields article. Billing Letter Templates Billing Statement The billing statement is a letter template located within Settings &gt;Communication &gt; Letter Templates &gt; Billing Statement. This statement is included as a link in the email templates listed below: Account Overdue Account Overdue - Second Notice Account Overdue - Third Notice Billing Day Changed Statement Updated Upcoming Statement Upcoming Statement - Second Notice Upcoming Statement - Third Notice To learn more, please refer to the Creating &amp; Editing Letter Templates article. Tax Statement The tax statement is a letter template located within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Letter Templates &gt; Tax Statement. The tax statement is a link located within the Billing Management tab of the Parent Portal within the Ledger header. Payers can download their tax statements for any calendar year they have made payments for. This statement will include all payments within a calendar year, defined as January 1st through December 31st. It will also split those payments into the specific categories that they have been applied to. IMPORTANT: The statement cannot currently be hidden or removed from the portal.

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment supports an extremely flexible payment plan system that can be customized to suit your school's needs. IMPORTANT: For schools that are not set up with our Billing Module, click here to learn about payment plans and schedules for your current setup. In this article Payment Plans for Billing schools vs. those without our billing module Payment Plan Columns and Actions Setting up Payment Plans Payment Plan Schedules How to Set Up Specific Plans Payment Plans for Billing schools vs. those without our billing module Payment Plans and Payment Schedules are available on contracts for schools with and without our Billing Module. However, there are some important differences for our Billing Customers, which include: All payment plans are based on Net Tuition by default. All payment plans must have a schedule. An error will display on the payment plans page if a schedule is missing. Please note : The due date of payment plan schedules is based on the Billing Date. Click here to learn more. Multiple payment plan schedules can be set up within a single payment plan to support mid-year enrollment and rolling enrollment. Payment Plan Columns and Actions Within Settings--&gt;Financial--&gt;Payment Plans , you can view/manage the following: Term/School Year Picker: Select the term/school year you wish to view data for from the drop-down menu. Add a new payment plan: This option allows you to create a new payment plan. Active?: This indicates if the payment plan is an available option on the contract/registration form. Canonical Name: This is the name of the payment plan used on the back end of the system. Default?: This indicates if a payment plan option is selected by default on the contract. No. of payments: The number of payments assigned to the payment plan, which can range from 1 payment up to 12 payments. You can also select the Due Immediately option from this dropdown. When selected, it means that payments would be due at the time of contract signing. In other words, when a family is completing their contract, if they were to opt for the plan that was \"Due Immediately\", they would be prompted to pay their tuition right then and there. Please note: if you are utilizing this option, the 'Collect Deposit' box needs to be checked off within your Deposit page (even if you do not charge a deposit fee). Has Associated Fee: This means there is a fee or discount enabled within the plan. Has Schedule: This indicates whether or not you have a payment schedule set up. If there is no schedule set up within the plan, a red triangle will show in this column. IMPORTANT: Each payment plan must have a schedule set up for billing to work. Last Edit: The date the last edit was made. Edit History: Click on the ' view recent changes ' link to see details of up to the last 5 dates changes were made to the payment plan. Edit: Click here to edit the details of the payment plan. Delete: Click here to delete the payment plan. Ledger Lock The Ledger Lock feature lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on or before the set date. Ledger Lock is set up on your Billing Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). Here's how the Ledger Lock feature impacts the Payment Plans: If a payment plan includes a locked month, the plan will not show up as an option on contracts. In addition, a flag will appear in the Has Schedule column of this page to let you know that the plan will not appear on contracts due to locked dates. Flagged plans can still be edited. Read more about Ledger Lock and how it affects other areas of your site in our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. Setting up Payment Plans To build a new plan, select ' Add a new Payment Plan '. To edit an existing plan, ' Edit ' on the right side of the page. Once you select, one of these, the 'Edit Payment Plan' window will open. Within this window, you can set or update the following details: Name: The canonical name of the payment plan. This name is internal only and is never displayed to parents. Once you set a canonical name (when building a new payment plan from scratch) it is frozen and can not be altered at any later point in time. The canonical name is used for business rules, so the system keeps this name for life to ensure no changes can be made that would break the rule. If you are editing an existing plan, the canonical name will be greyed out, as seen below. Number of payments: This is the number of payments within the plan. Payment Plan Schedules Payment Plan Schedules are used to create billing installments on contract submission. Each schedule allows you to set the number of payments, the percentage due for each payment, and the months that they are due. The due date of any schedule/plan is determined on the Billing setup page ( Settings --&gt; Financial--&gt; Billing Setup ), or within the individual payer's record. Click here to learn more. Add New Schedule: This allows you to add a new payment plan schedule with a start month/year and to set the percentage amount due per payment. We support multiple schedules to support mid-year enrollment and rolling enrollment. Multiple Schedules: To enroll kids mid-year or after the start date of your payment plans, you can add multiple schedules for any of your plans that have more than one payment. For example, if you have a 10 month plan, you can setup a schedule for 9 months, 8 months, 7 months, etc. Just click on ' add new schedule ' and set up the start months later in the cycle. Applicants that enroll past the start date of the 10-month plan can still select this plan later on in the cycle and their payments will adjust automatically. Explanation: This is the text the parent sees on the contract while selecting and reviewing payment plan options. The explanation text is like the parent-facing title of the plan. Contractual Text: This text shows when a parent clicks to select a plan. It displays as grey text under the explanation. This is typically used for a declaration of payment such as \"I/We agree to pay our balance in 'x' installments by 'x' date.\" Confirmation Text: This text will show next to a required checkbox within the contract underneath the contractual text. If using Confirmation Text, the parent will be required to mark the box as complete before proceeding. Internal View when editing the plan language: What the above looks like on the contract: Contract Fees (optional): This is an optional amount charged or discounted if this particular payment plan option is selected. The fee is defined on the Contract Fee page and can be a fixed amount or percentage due. The payment plan fee is defined on a per-plan basis. Business Rule (optional): Business rules can be used to define whether or not the payment plan is offered to parents on the contract. For example, some schools only allow payment plans for domestic students or students receiving financial aid. Adding a business rule is something you have access to manage on your end if you know how to write liquid , however, our team is happy to help. Contact support if you need assistance adding or writing a rule. Default: The default option defines whether this option is selected by default when a parent views a contract. Active: This indicates if this payment plan is active. Save: Click here to save your changes and exit this screen. Apply: Click here to apply your changes and refresh the edit window. How to Edit a Schedule Click on the pencil along the right to edit the schedule details. You can also delete a payment plan schedule by clicking on the trashcan. Within the edit view you can manage the following: Number of payments: The number of payments assigned to the plan. Schedule: Set each payment's start month, year, and percentage amount. Once you set the first schedule, the remaining schedules will auto-fill. You can always overwrite and personalize any of the schedule details as needed for your process. Percent : The percent of each payment is automatically calculated when you select the number of payments. You can, however, set percentages manually by clicking in the box. When setting percentages manually, they must equal 100% for the schedule to work. You will see a warning message if they don't add up to 100%. How to Set Up Specific Plans Payment Plans can be setup in different ways, based upon the needs of your school. This section will review the different payment plan types and how to set them up. Pay In Full Plan This payment plan allows tuition and additional fees to be due at the time of signing the contract. First, you will need to create a new payment plan and name it. On the second field for \"Number of Payments\" choose \"Due Immediately\". Type in an explanation and fill out any other fields that you would like your payers to see when choosing this plan. Then select if you would want this plan to be active or not and then hit save. On the contract, if someone chooses this plan, they will not see a deposit line item, like they would on any other payment plan. Instead, they will see their \"Total After Payment\" amount shown as $0. Important Note: This payment plan does not work if you do not collect a deposit. Non-Cascading (One Schedule) Payment Plan A non-cascading payment plan is a payment plan that only contains one schedule. This is beneficial when you don\u2019t want the contract to auto-adjust to the current month. For example, when you need to update a payment plan\u2019s past charge schedule, you would select a non-cascading plan when managing the contract regeneration. Setting up a non-cascading payment plan will follow the same workflow as described above with other payment plans. However, with this type of plan, you will only have one Plan Schedule, as pictured below. Pro Tip: Include the word \u2018non_cascading\u2019 when naming the payment plan to help you distinguish between this plan and any plans that you have with cascading schedules Cascading (Multiple Schedule) Payment Plan Creating multiple schedules within a payment plan allows your plans to adjust automatically based on when the parent completes their contract. For example, if you have a 6-payment plan that starts in June, but then you accept a new student sometime in July, with a cascading payment plan set up, the parent could see their first payment as due in August (rather than in June). Here are some variations of cascading payment plans: A multi-payment plan that tapers For example: First schedule: 6 Payments &gt; starts in June Second schedule: 5 Payments &gt; starts in July Third schedule: 4 Payments &gt; starts in August etc. A multi-payment plan that has the same number of payments in each schedule For example: First schedule: 6 Payments &gt; Starts in June Second schedule: 6 Payments &gt; Starts in July Third schedule: 6 Payments &gt; Starts in August etc. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Payment Plans Overview Settings: Billing Setup Page",

    "body": "Overview The Draft Applications page lets you see which students have an application form currently in progress and how far along they are in the process. Some of these draft applicants may have previously inquired with your school, whereas some may have jumped straight to applying. Families that previously inquired will have records in the system with contact information so that you can interact with them, whereas direct applicants do not. Learn how to invite these families to events, answer their questions, and/or get them on the phone while their form is pending completion! There are two ways to access the Draft Applications page: Navigate to your Admissions tab - Forms sub-tab - Draft Applications . Click on your name in the upper right of Finalsite Enrollment - Forms to Import - Draft Applications. How-To: Understand &amp; Sort Draft Application Columns Once you are on the Draft Applications page, you will see a list of any students who have an application in progress, and the following columns will be displayed. You can click on any of the column headers to sort on that column (in ascending or descending order). By default, the page is ordered alphabetically by Name on Form (i.e. student name). Name on Form: The name of the student as entered on the Application Form. You can click the student name to preview the application form and see what the family has filled out so far. If you have any draft applications in the list without a name in this column, this means that the family started the application form but have not yet filled in the student name field. Form Type: Displays the form type, which is Application. Status: Displays the current status of the application, which will be one of the following: Draft: The application form is in progress and the parent/guardian clicked on save and finish later on any page before the application fee payment page. Pending Payment: The parent/guardian has completed all of the pages of the application form and is on the application fee payment page, but has not yet submitted their payment. When draft applications are in pending payment, you will see the option to force submit the form on the admin side - see the information on 'Submit Form' functionality below for more details. Start Date: The date that the application form was started in the portal. Last Updated Date: The date that the application form was last accessed and updated in the portal. Apply Grade: The apply grade for the student as entered on the Application Form. Apply Year: The apply year (term) for the student as entered on the Application Form. User Name: The name associated with the parent portal account used to start the form. User Email: The email associated with the parent portal account used to start the form. This email can be used for communications. This is also helpful if the parent hasn't yet entered their personal email in the form. Submit Form: A 'Submit Form' button will appear in this column only for applications that are in the Pending Payment status. This means that the parent/guardian saved on the application fee payment page, but did not yet complete the payment. As an admin/user, you can click on the Submit Form button to force submit the application. This is a useful tool when you're working with families who are planning to pay the application fee via any method that isn\u2019t listed on the application fee page, or when you want to waive the application fee for a family on an individual basis. Once you submit the form, you will need to mark the application fee checklist item complete from their contact record . How-To: Use Action Menus on the Draft Applications Page To communicate and interact with your draft applicants, select contacts in bulk or individually by marking the checkboxes next to each name along the left. This will activate your bulk actions in the upper right of the page. Communicate Menu Within the Communicate Menu, you have access to the Send Email action, which allows you to send an email to the parent/guardian using the email on their Parent Portal Account (i.e. the email listed in the 'User Email' column). Please note that this may be different from the email they list as their contact email on the application form itself. At this time, custom email templates will not be available to choose from when sending an email from the Draft Applications page; however, you can copy and paste them in and your custom formatting will be maintained. Edit Menu Within the Edit Menu, you have access to two actions, as described below: Export to CSV: Use this action to export all information from the draft application forms to a CSV file. This provides an opportunity to work with the data while it's pending to be brought into the system so that you can track your touch points with families and make notes. Delete Application(s): This will permanently delete the selected draft application(s) from the system. You will be asked to confirm the action once you make this selection. This action cannot be reversed!

    "body": "Overview Non-term-based fields , which include any custom enrollment fields that were created for your process and any fields not listed as ' term-based ,' will NOT clear out automatically each year. This means each school will need to manually clear out and/or reset the values of these fields year over year after rollover and prior to contract generation if they drive tuition and fees, checklist items, etc. Clearing out non-term-based fields is a step in your Enrollment Refresh Process tracker located in Settings &gt; General &gt; Enrollment Refresh Process . We recommend creating a saved search of all fields you want to clear out. Read on to learn more! In this Article Non-Term-Based Field Examples How-To: Set Required Fields for Contract Generation How-To: Clear Out or Update Fields Non-Term-Based Field Examples The specific non-term-based fields to clear out for the new enrollment year will be unique to your school. However, some common examples of fields that you may need to review and reset include: Intent to Enroll: The value of this field will remain year over year unless cleared out. This field typically drives checklist items to be hidden or displayed, as well as some automated communication plans , so it's important to clear out the value each year. Custom Financial Aid and Scholarship Fields: The standard scholarship_amount and financial_aid_amount fields are term-based . However, any additional custom fields for financial aid/tuition assistance and scholarships will need to be reset each year. Transportation Fees: If you collect information on how the students will commute to your school (e.g. school bus, drop-off, or walk), you may want to clear this field out as it could drive contract fees or checklist items . Activity Fees: If you collect fees for any clubs or programs, these could change year over year based on student interest and/or fee changes. T-shirt Fees/Field Trip Fees: If you collect fees for 'add-ons' like t-shirts or school trips, these could change year over year based on student interest and/or fee changes. Any other custom ad-hoc fees that you include on your contract should be reviewed. How-To: Set Required Fields for Contract Generation Within your contract terms, you may have certain pieces of information that vary year over year or that change based upon contract timing, and you want to make sure these are filled out upon generation of a new contract. Some common examples include contract/deposit due dates or program selections. If this is the case for your school, the process is as follows: Contact Support and list the fields that you would like to be set as required upon contract generation. A maximum of nine (9) fields can be set as required for the contract generation process. These custom fields will be added to your contract language as dynamic merge fields , according to the contract terms and language you provide to the Support Team. Once you generate contracts in bulk or individually, you will see the ' Confirm Contract Generation ' window and will be asked to set the value of any required fields before you can proceed with generating the contract. These values will display within the contract terms where the merge fields have been placed. How-To: Clear Out or Update Fields Best Practice: Create a saved search displaying all the fields you need to clear out year-over-year as columns . This way you can pull it up each year, export it as an import template, and clear all fields at once using an update-type contact import . Follow these steps to clear out or update fields in bulk through a list page: 1. After you perform rollover for your returning students , they will move to the Enrollment tab - 'Students in Enrollment' list page. 2. If you need to apply Filter Options on the page, please do so. 3. Select your contacts in bulk, then click on the green 'Edit' button and select the ' Update a Field' option. 4. Type in the display name of the field that you need to clear out or change. Once the field is located, you can either update the value to be blank* or change it to another value. Then, click the blue 'Next' button. *Please note: Boolean (yes/no) fields cannot be changed to blank using a bulk edit. You must import in a value of WRITE_BLANK to clear out these fields for students. 5. You will be asked to confirm this change with some important information before it takes place. After reviewing the information and confirming the changes, click the blue ' Update' button. For any fields that were blanked out or overwritten, you can follow the same steps above to set new values in bulk prior to contract generation.

    "body": "Overview During the Admissions process, prospective families will have a variety of questions about your school and want to make sure they find the best fit for their student and family. To build more personal relationships with families, you can set up automated emails that answer common questions and help families see their place in the story of your school. In addition, you can automate internal reminders for follow-up actions your team needs to take, such as making phone calls, mailing tickets home for a school play, etc. Important Notes Please note, your field names and values may differ from these examples. Be sure to double-check on the fields setup page in your site by navigating to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields. You may also have custom statuses that you want to use to trigger your ACP steps, instead of the standard statuses described below. Communication plans trigger based on the first time a student enters a status and will not be duplicated if the student moves out of that status and then back into it. For example, if you have a communication plan set up to email students when they become applicants, that same communication plan will not be triggered to be sent again if the student were to move into Application Completed and then moved back to Applicant. Enrollment ACPs: Any Automated Communication Plan that triggers based on the student's status becoming Enrollment in Progress must be set up and activated before rollover in order for the plan to trigger the communication.

You could also set up an internal reminder using the same Trigger and Additional Criteria in the above example if you want to have a member of your staff reach out to the family directly to invite them to the soccer game. -- Email to Coach or Academic Program Lead about Prospective Students If a prospective student indicates an interest in a specific sport or academic program, you may want to notify the coach or program lead so that they can personally follow up. Coaches and academic staff members can be set up in the system with 'Limited User' accounts so that you can email them within automated communication plans, but they will not have access to data in Finalsite Enrollment. Once you have accounts created in the system for these additional staff members, you can set up an ACP step to email them directly. 1. Set the Trigger to be a Status of 'Inquiry' or 'Applicant' as applicable. 2. Set Additional Criteria based on your academic/athletic or student interests field. 3. Set the Perform Action box to Send Email . 4. Select the desired Time to send the email.

    "body": "Overview During the Enrollment process, families can have a variety of questions about where they are in the process. Newly enrolling students will need to be introduced to your school's enrollment steps, while those returning to your school may need reminders of what forms to fill out or where to go in the Parent Portal to complete enrollment for the new year. With automated communication plans, you can set up automated emails that answer common questions and help families start off the school year right. In addition, you can automate internal reminders for follow-up actions your team needs to take, such as making phone calls, mailing packets home, etc. To learn how to set up automated communication plan (ACP) steps and best practices for doing so, check out the following related content: Automated Communication Plan Setup Automated Communication Plan Best Practices For ideas of ACPs that you can create for the Inquiry/Admissions process, click here . Click to jump to: Information-Based Communication Plan Steps Enrollment Checklist Reminder Emails Enrollment Complete Email to Parents Survey Link Email to Families Not Re-Enrolling Reminder to Change Status of Students Interest-Based Communication Plan Steps Email Invitation to a Student Welcome Event Important Notes Please note, your field names and values may differ from these examples. Be sure to double-check on the fields setup page in your site by navigating to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Fields. You may also have custom statuses that you want to use to trigger your ACP steps, instead of the standard statuses described below. Communication plans trigger based on the first time a student enters a status and will not be duplicated if the student moves out of that status and then back into it. For example, if you have a communication plan set up to email students when they become applicants, that same communication plan will not be triggered to be sent again if the student were to move into Application Completed and then moved back to Applicant. Enrollment ACPs: Any Automated Communication Plan that triggers based on the student's status becoming Enrollment in Progress must be set up and activated before rollover in order for the plan to trigger the communication. Information-Based Communication Plan Steps Enrollment Checklist Reminder Emails This ACP step is for sending a reminder email to enrolling students who have not yet completed all required items on their checklist. You can specify the checklist items they still have pending, remind them of any upcoming deadlines, and provide information on who to contact if they need help. This communication can be sent on multiple dates using multiple ACP steps. For example, the first reminder email can go out four (4) weeks before the deadline, a second reminder email can go out two (2) weeks before the deadline, and a third and final reminder email can go out a week before the deadline. The final email template may be different than the first two or you can use the same one. 1. Set the Trigger to be a Status of 'Enrollment in Progress'. 2. Set the Perform Action box to Send Email . 3. Select the desired Time to send the email. You can choose to send the email immediately, a set number of days after the trigger, or on a specific date. 4. If you selected the \"N days after trigger\" or \"On date\" time option, specify the number of days or date, as well as the time, you would like the email to go out. 5. Set the Email Recipients (i.e. 'send to') as applicable. 6. Select your pre-saved Enrollment Checklist Reminder email template . Note: We provide schools with this template, which you should customize with your brand and voice. If you don't have the email template, contact Support and they can add it for you. The merge field that brings in the student's checklist items can be found under the Contact grouping - 'Checklist Enrollment' (or 'Checklist Enrollment Incomplete'). Click here for more information on using the student checklist merge fields. 7. Click Save . Repeat this for additional dates you want the email to go out. Anyone that becomes Enrolled (or another status) after the first reminder email went out will not receive any remaining notifications. -- Enrollment Complete Email to Parents Once all required checklist items have been marked complete, you can automate an email to parents letting them know that all requirements have been met. You could also include a link to a school calendar, invitation to a welcome event, or any other relevant next steps. 1. Set the Trigger to be a Status of 'Enrolled'. 2. Set the Perform Action box to Send Email . 3. Select the desired Time to send the email. You can choose to send the email immediately, a set number of days after the trigger, or on a specific date. 4. If you selected the \"N days after trigger\" or \"On date\" time option, specify the number of days or date, as well as the time, you would like the email to go out. 5. Set the Email Recipients (i.e. 'send to') as applicable. 6. Select your pre-saved Enrollment Complete email template . 7. Click Save . -- Survey Link Email to Families Not Re-Enrolling If you have an online 'Intent to Enroll' form containing a boolean (yes/no) field asking the family if they will be enrolling for the year, you can trigger an ACP step based on this field to collect more information. 1. Set the Trigger to be a Completed Checklist Item of 'Intent to Enroll' (name of your online form checklist item may vary). 2. Set Additional Criteria based on your intent to enroll field. For example: Field: Enroll Intent Operator: is Value: No 3. Set the Perform Action box to Send Email . 4. Select the desired Time to send the email. You can choose to send the email immediately, a set number of days after the trigger, or on a specific date. 5. If you selected the \"N days after trigger\" or \"On date\" time option, specify the number of days or date, as well as the time, you would like the email to go out. 6. Set the Email Recipients (i.e. 'send to') as applicable. 7. Select your pre-saved email template , which can request more information from the family or simply contain a link to an anonymous 'Reason for Not Re-Enrolling' survey. 8. Click Save . You could also set up an internal reminder using the same Trigger and Additional Criteria in the above example if you want to have a member of your staff reach out to the family directly about their decision to not re-enroll. -- Reminder to Change Status of Students If you have an online 'Intent to Enroll' form containing a boolean (yes/no) field asking the family if they will be enrolling for the year, you can trigger an ACP step based on this field to notify your internal team that a student's status should be changed in the system. 1. Set the Trigger to be a Completed Checklist Item of 'Intent to Enroll' (name of your online form checklist item may vary). 2. Set Additional Criteria based on your intent to enroll field. For example: Field: Enroll Intent Operator: is Value: No 3. Set the Perform Action box to Create Reminder . 4. Select the desired Time to create the reminder. You can choose to create the reminder immediately, a set number of days after the trigger, or on a specific date. 5. If you selected the \"N days after trigger\" or \"On date\" time option, specify the number of days or date, as well as the time, you would like the reminder to go out. 6. Set the Reminder Assignment (i.e. which team members are assigned the reminder) as appropriate. 7. Set the Reminder Text to change the student's status to not enrolling, declined offer, or any other relevant status. 8. Click Save . -- Interest-Based Communication Plan Steps IMPORTANT: Please note, your field names and values may differ from these examples. Be sure to double-check on the fields setup page in your site by navigating to 'Settings' - 'Fields &amp; Data' - 'Fields'. You may also have custom statuses that you want to use to trigger your ACP steps, instead of the standard statuses described below. -- Email Invitation to a Student Welcome Event 1. Set the Trigger to be a Completed Checklist Item of 'Contract'. You can also use a status trigger here. However, if you want flexibility in sending an invite email to students in various statuses (e.g. enrollment in progress, enrolled), then it's best to use a checklist item trigger since you can only pick one status when using the status trigger. If your event is only for New or only for Returning students, you can add Additional Criteria based on the 'Enrollment Type' field. 2. Set the Perform Action box to Send Email . 3. Select the desired Time to send the email. You can choose to send the email immediately, a set number of days after the trigger, or on a specific date. 4. If you selected the \"N days after trigger\" or \"On date\" time option, specify the number of days or date, as well as the time, you would like the email to go out. 5. Set the Email Recipients (i.e. 'send to') as applicable. 6. Select your pre-saved email template containing the invitation to the event and event details. 7. Click Save . You could also set up an internal reminder using the same Trigger in the above example if you want to have a member of your staff reach out to the family directly to invite them to the event. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Automated Communication Plan Setup Best Practices for Automated Communication Plans (ACPs) Inquiry &amp; Admissions Automated Communication Plans",

    "body": "Fee and Payment FAQs How do you add a paper check payment? Once a paper check has been received, you will go to the student's billing tab, select the link to the responsible parent, select the ledger tab on their profile, and choose to 'Add a payment'. For further details about this process, read the Billing: Add Payment article. Important note: Do not add a deposit payment to the billing tab. Deposits added to the checklist will automatically be duplicated and added to the parent's ledger on both the Admin side and in the Parent Portal. How do you add a late fee? You can add a late fee at any time. To see a list of late/overdue accounts, go to your ' Billing ' list page and select the ' Accounts ' tab. If a parent is late with a payment you will see a red overdue flag. You can then select that parent and choose to ' Add a Charge '. For further details about this process, read this Billing: Add Charge article. You can also set up auto late fees through your billing setup page. Go to settings, financial, and then select billing setup. Halfway down the page, you will see Late Fee Setup. Here you turn on or off automatic late fees and set the amount. Your late fees will be charged based on the settings underneath the billing setup section with your grace period and overdue threshold. You will also need a parent-based category grouping to use as the category for your late fee. How are incidentals (uniforms, field trips, supplies) handled? You can add charges at any point during the school year either individually or in bulk. To add a charge individually, go to the student's billing tab, select the link to the financially responsible parent, and select ' Add a Charge '. For further details about this process, read the Billing: Add Charge article. You can also add charges or credits in bulk within the student billing list page or through a billing import. Click here to learn how to add fees in bulk from the 'Students' list page. Click here to learn how to import charges, payments, and credits. What if a student leaves mid-year? What happens to their payment plan? Nothing happens to a student\u2019s payment schedule automatically when marking a student as Mid Year Withdrawal. If you wish to waive the remaining balance, please see our Managing a Midyear Withdrawal Student article for more details. How do we assign a financial split for tuition payments? To update a financial split you will need to go to the student's 'Portal Accounts' tab. Select any displayed percentage to edit. Important note: Assigning a split will not correct a charge that has already been posted to an account. You will need to manually adjust any posted amount to reflect this change. Click here to learn more. What do I do if a parent would like to change their selected payment plan? Option 1: If you need to make changes to future charges only, use the \u2018Rearrange Installments\u2019 button within the Ledger of the payer\u2019s record to easily adjust the scheduled payment plan internally . Important Notes: The ledger will not match what is on the submitted contract. The adjustment will be applied to all payers with a percentage of financial responsibility for the student . Click here to learn more about financial responsibility settings. The original contract (before adjustments) will still be available within the Parent Portal. Click here to learn how to use this feature. Option 2: If you need the contract to match the ledger, you can regenerate the contract with the parent\u2019s signature. This option will allow the parent to select their new payment plan, which will be reflected on the ledger upon submission of the contract. For this option, you\u2019ll need a non-cascading payment plan . Click here to learn more. Important Notes: Parent signature is required. The ledger and contract will match. The contract will still be available in the Parent Portal. Click here to learn how to use this option. Option 3. If you don\u2019t need a signed contract that matches the payment plan on the ledger, you can regenerate and submit the contract internally. The benefit of internal contract regeneration/submission is that it doesn\u2019t require the parent's signature. In other words, the entire process can be managed internally . For this option, you\u2019ll need a non-cascading payment plan . Click here to learn more. Important Notes: The ledger will not match what is on the submitted contract. The contract will no longer be visible in the Parent Portal (you will download and retain an internal copy). The adjustment will be applied to all payers with a percentage of financial responsibility for the student . Click here to learn how to use this option. Additional Resources: To learn how to set up a new payment plan option to be represented on the contract, click here . When will a parent receive automated communications about their balance and account activity? Parents receive an automated statement 10 days prior to their withdrawal date if an account balance exists . This statement includes all activity posted for that withdrawal date. For more information on billing communications, click here. Can auto-messages be turned off in the billing platform? All system-automated billing communications cannot be turned off at this time. If you would like to avoid late communications from being sent to a parent, you can place the student into an inactive status such as ' Financial Hold ', and delete the charge on the parent's billing tab. To learn which billing communications are automated, click here . How can a parent make a payment early or make a partial payment on their account? Parents can make early payments and pay any custom amounts at any time towards their next balance within the Parent Portal. Please note, any large lump sum payments will not be spread across the remaining payment schedule. How do parents update their payment information? Parents can update their payment information via the parent portal at any time by selecting their Billing Management tab within the Parent Portal. How do I add another payer or financially responsible person to a student's account? To add a new payer go to the student's ' Summary ' tab and select ' Add a related contact ' in the bottom left below the checklist. This contact will need to be listed as a parent or guardian in order to receive portal access. Then go to the ' Households ' tab and adjust the percentage of financial responsibility by clicking on any percentage. For more information on setting up a split, click here . IMPORTANT: Don't forget to adjust any posted amount on the parent's billing tab if you are making this change within 10 days of the due date. Can parents clear out their payment methods (in billing)? The parent can update, enable, and disable payment methods at any time within their Billing Management tab of the Parent Portal. Note: If Autopay is set as required by your school, parents must have one saved payment method on file meaning that in order to change or remove a payment method, they must first have two payment methods added to their account. Background: It is legally required that if you handle ACH payments to allow parents/payers to update their billing information at any time. If you do not provide a method online, there are additional requirements surrounding collecting and managing those authorization forms from how you collect and handle the authorization form to how fast you turn around each update request. We issued Financial Aid to a student after the signing of the contract. How do I set this up in billing? The best option is to re-generate the contract to reflect this financial aid award. If this is not an option you can apply a lump-sum credit to the next payment or break this amount into several added monthly credits on the parent's billing tab. To learn how to add a credit, click here . How should schools carry over previous year balances? If you have previous balances that need to be brought into Finalsite Enrollment when you are first setting up with our Billing Module, you can create a Billing category, such as, 'Previous Year Balance 22-23' . You could then upload all owed balances into that category. This will allow you to either consider or filter out these previous balances when looking at your reporting. Click here to review our article on Billing Categories. Please note: To do this, your students will have to already have ledgers established. When importing or adding these amounts into the ledger, you will select to upload the balance to the current term. What happens to a balance from a previous month that goes unpaid? It rolls over to be owed the following month. For example, if a parent owes $50 on September 1st and doesn't pay, on October 1st they will owe that $50 PLUS whatever other charges apply for the month of October. Is the late fee only charged once or can you set it as recurring? Automatic Late fee charges are recurring, meaning they will continue to be charged every month that the account remains overdue. Please note , late fees are applied according to the grace period and/or overdue threshold amount if either of these is set. In addition, once enabled, late fees will only apply moving forward, they will not be added to any amount that was considered overdue before enabling Automatic Late Fees within your site. You can read more about late fees here. Can a parent/guardian with a Billing ledger be deleted? Yes, payers with billing ledgers may be deleted by using the \u2018Delete Record\u2019 option within the Edit menu of their record. To be deleted, the contact must meet the following criteria: They can not have any Electronic Payments attached to their ledger. They must be set to 0% financially responsible in the current term and all previous ones for all students that they are attached to. Please keep in mind that this action can not be undone and it will permanently remove all data directly associated with the record. If there is a duplicate record that you are trying to resolve, merging the two records might be a more suitable option to preserve all data. For a more detailed overview of deleting and merging records, please see this article . Can duplicate billing records be merged? Yes, records with Billing ledgers attached can be merged together through the duplicate contact matching tool (Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Duplicate Contact Matching). For a more detailed overview of merging a duplicate billing record, please refer to this article. Autopay Can parents change the Autopay draft date on their account? Yes, you can enable settings that allow parents the flexibility of managing their Autopay date(s) within the parent portal. Please refer to our Billing: Managing Autopay article for more information. How can I see who is signed up for Autopay? To see who has signed up for Autopay, go to your ' Billing ' list page and select the ' Accounts ' tab. You will see a green checkmark in the ' Autopay ' column if that parent has signed up for Autopay. If a payment fails and it turns off Autopay, does it permanently leave Autopay off? This depends on your Billing settings. Under Setting &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup, if you have enabled Retry Failed Autopay Payments, the system will reattempt the charge again for many failed payments. You can read more about this feature in our Retry Failed Autopay Payments article. Do Autopay and Payment Profiles clear out each year? No, neither Autopay nor any saved payment profile data will clear out when a new term/school year has begun. All payment profiles and Autopay data are retained with each new school year. Parents can update their payment profiles at any point throughout the year. Autopay will remain on unless turned off by an admin, turned off due to a failed payment, (or, if it's not set as required by your school) turned off by a parent/payer.

    "body": "Overview Many schools that accept international students work with consultants or agents. These contacts are supported within Finalsite Enrollment so they can assist families with their Admissions process from beginning to end. This article will go over how to add, manage, and communicate with Consultants in your Finalsite Enrollment system. In this article Adding Consultants Individually In Bulk Linking Consultants to Students Consultant Data and Searching Communicating with Consultants Managing Consultant Parent Portal Access Adding Consultants Adding Individual Consultants You can easily add a new Consultant to your Finalsite Enrollment site by using the Quick Action (+) Menu in the upper right by your name. From this menu, you will want to select the ' Add Prospect or Consultant' option. Type the consultant's first and last name in the boxes provided, then press the ' Enter ' key as instructed. The system will search for potential duplicate records. If any potential duplicate consultants are found, they will be listed and you can choose to view or update the existing contact at this time. You can also choose to 'Create a New Contact' if none of the potential duplicates match the new one you are creating. For creating the new Consultant contact, you will want to set the ' Contact Role ' to ' Consultant ' and add a phone number. Then, click on the blue ' Add Contact ' button. The Consultant will now have a record in the system as an \"out of workflow\" contact . Adding Consultants in Bulk (via Import) If there are multiple Consultants that you want to add to Finalsite Enrollment, you may want to import instead of adding them one by one. To do so, you can follow these steps: Download the Consultant Import Template . Open the template in Excel and add the consultant information, one consultant per row. Save your file as a .CSV. Navigate to 'Settings' - 'Fields &amp; Data' - Import Data Tool in your Finalsite Enrollment site and import the file. Linking Consultants to Students You can create relationships with consultees within the contact record . To navigate to the Consultant's contact record, click on the ' View ' link upon contact creation or use the quick search in the upper right of Finalsite Enrollment to find them by name. To create a relationship between a Consultant and a Consultee, scroll down to the bottom-left section of the contact record titled ' Related Contacts ', then click the green plus (+) button to add a related contact. Please note: You can also create the relationship from the student's contact record within this same section. Type in the first and last name of the contact you want to link and press the ' Enter ' key to search for matching records. Once the contact is found, select the ' Use this contact &amp; link to the current record ' option and set the relationship as 'Consultee'. Click the blue checkmark button to save it. NOTE: If you are setting a relationship to a Consultant within the student's contact record, you would set the relationship as 'Consultant'. The relationship will be set and the contact records will be tied together as shown below. Consultant Data and Searching Export You can not pull a search that brings in the student's name and the consultants that they are connected with, however, you can use an export to accomplish this. Our Consultant Export is free and it's quick and easy for our team to add to your site. You might even already have one! Check this under Setting &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Data Export . Select Run an Export Open the Export Configuration dropdown If you see, Consultant Export in the list, you already have one! How to use To use your consultant export, you need to use or create a search that pulls in a list of students you'd like to see this data on. An example might be to pull in all students in the Admissions workflow, or all students in the Enrollment workflow, or both! For an in-depth guide to running the actual export, check out our Data Export article. Searches Role = Consultant To find a list of all of the consultants within your site, you can search by Role. First select All other fields in the Search by dropdown. In the field dropdown, select Role &gt; is &gt; Consultant. Activity Type Another option for searching Consultant data is to utilize Activity types and notes. Create an Activity Item. Perhaps label it as something like \"Consultant Communication\" if you'd like to track your communications with Consultants. Add a note. On the Consultant's record (or through a search), use the Activity type to label the notes you add to them. Bulk Updates including adding notes to the record can be accomplished within a search. Or, on the Consultant's record . Use the data in a search! For Example: Search for everyone whose Role is Consultant AND Consultant Communication date is not Today . This would pull us a list of all consultants that you have tagged with the Activity Type \"Consultant Communication\" on any date other than today. You could also use the is identifier to search for tags labeled on today or another specific date. Communicating with Consultants When sending an email (either individually within a student's contact record or in bulk from a list page or search), you can choose to send communications to ' Consultants of selected contacts .' This will email any Consultants who are linked to the selected student. Please note: If you are searching directly for Consultants (i.e. by searching for 'Role' = Consultant), you would choose the 'Selected Contacts' option instead, since in this case, the Consultants are the selected contacts instead of the students. Managing Consultant Parent Portal Access Consultants can have Parent Portal access in the same way that a parent/guardian does. If the Consultant was the one who completed the student's Application Form, they will be authenticated automatically to that student and their checklist in the Parent Portal. Otherwise, you can manage authentication within the ' Portal Accounts ' page of the student's contact record by clicking on the monitor icon towards the upper right, or navigating to 'Households' - ' Parent Portal Access ' within the record. Consultants will need to be authenticated to a student and granted Portal Access so that they can assist with the completion of checklist items. Financial Responsibility can be toggled off for Consultants if you need to prevent access to the contract form.

    "body": "Billing Communication FAQs Do I have to set up billing auto reminders? No, there are already several automatic reminders configured by default to help you communicate with parents. They include balance statements, payment receipts, and overdue reminders. You can read more about this and learn about managing these automatic communications within our Settings: Billing Setup Page article in the Email Notifications Settings section. How do I send text reminders for payments? Currently, automated reminders are only supported via email, but, you can manually send out a bulk text at any time. Read more about sending texts in our Sending Text Messages article . Can you build an automated communication plan for emailing a statement right to parents before the payment is due? Parents/guardians that are financially responsible will automatically receive a reminder 2 days before the payment is due. In addition, under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup , in the Email Notification Settings section, you can enable Automatic Statements and overdue notices to be sent. Check out our Settings: Billing Setup Page article to learn more. Billing statements can also be sent at any point in time on an individual basis within the payer's record by clicking on the Send Statement button. The payer will receive the Statement Updated email. This is useful when adding charges, credits, and/or payments to an individual ledger. Please note, manually sending billing statements in bulk is not available at this time. How do I customize the Billing emails with my school banner/logo? Review our Billing Communications article to learn which Billing templates are customizable. Adjustable billing emails are found under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails. Please note, the Billing Statement and Tax Statement are both letter templates found within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Letter Templates. Will the parent/payer get an automated updated statement email if a charge is added or a credit is applied? Not at this time. When adding charges or credits within the payer's record, click on the Send Statement button to send an updated statement to communicate recent changes. The parent/payer will receive the Statement Updated email. The template for this email can be edited within Settings &gt; Communications &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing. Can I manually send additional overdue email communications? Yes, you can manually send additional overdue emails. The system overdue email is sent immediately once the payment amount is overdue, which is determined by the overdue threshold and Grace Period being met or exceeded. If you'd like to send an additional communication, you can: Create a custom report within the search &amp; reports page to look for Account Overdue is YES within the Contact Record Data search criteria. Next, you'll want to send an email to the selected contacts since the criteria is pulling all payer account names that are overdue. Can I hide the tax statement within the Parent Portal? Not at this time. However, the tax statement can be customized within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Letter Templates &gt; Tax Statement. If a contract is deleted, will the parent/payer still receive billing communications? If there are items/amounts due on the parent/payer's ledger, they will still receive all billing communications. The ledger will need to be adjusted to a zero balance if no further billing communications should be received. Will billing statements/upcoming payment emails go out each month for families on semi-annual or quarterly payment plans? Regardless of the payment plan, billing statement emails, and upcoming payment emails will be sent either if the upcoming current balance due for that month is a positive balance or credit balance . In other words , only if the balance that is due for the payer is $0.00 , no email is sent. If the parent payer has any positive balance or negative (credit balance), they will receive the email for that month. Can I turn billing communications off for individual payers or a group of payers? Not at this time. Automated billing communications will be sent either if the ledger has a positive balance or a credit balance. In other words, the only way a payer would not receive billing communications is if the balance that is due for the payer is $0.00. If the parent payer has any positive balance or negative (credit balance), they will receive billing communications. Will Upcoming Payment and Upcoming Statement emails be sent if the parent/payer does not currently owe a balance? If enabled, the Upcoming Payment and Upcoming Statement emails will be sent if a parent/payer owes a balance on their ledger OR if they have a credit balance. For example, if a payer owes a balance of $100 they would receive these emails OR if a parent/payer has a negative balance (credit balance) -$100, they would also receive these emails. Read more about Billing Communications here. Can I set up an automated communication plan (PRO feature) for accounts that are overdue for \"x\" number of days? Not at this time. The system overdue email is sent immediately once the payment amount is overdue, which is determined by the overdue threshold and Grace Period being met or exceeded.

    "body": "How do you handle \"late\" tuition assistance that's applied after contracts are generated and issued? For schools that do not issue tuition assistance prior to contract signing, the recommended process is to issue an intent to enrollment form first, and then, issue contracts once tuition assistance is granted. This is the cleanest solution and complies with contract law, TILA disclosure requirements, and ease of use. Schools can optionally issue a contract with placeholder text and then re-issue a contract once tuition assistance is granted. While this is a valid solution, it may introduce extra overhead on parent communications. How do you handle continuous enrollment? Continuous enrollment typically has two distinct components: signing a contract (aka registration) and terms of service, and annual enrollment into tuition management. With Finalsite Enrollment we integrate the process into one easy step. For schools wishing to use continuous enrollment, we offer a dynamic registration process where parents of new students sign and agree to the terms of service via the contract in year 1, and then subsequent years the returning parent submits an intent to enroll confirmation and selects the payment plan. Please check out our Continuous or Perpetual Enrollment: Overview &amp; Best Practices article for more info! How much time does billing add to the implementation process? Billing itself adds minimal additional time to the implementation process since we leverage all the existing functionality within our enrollment product. The work to setup contracts and enrollment covers setting up billing. How do we convert our SMART/FACTS accounts to Finalsite Enrollment? Billing is 100% integrated into our enrollment process so there is no need to migrate SMART/FACTS accounts over. Can we use 2 different tuition management systems at the same time? (Like FACTS for financial aid and Finalsite Enrollment for billing). Schools can use other financial systems like SSS or FACTS. Can a parent use their 529 plan to pay for tuition? If they choose to, the parent can send a check straight from their 529 system to the school. The school would process this similar to a normal check. Do you have a dedicated support team just for billing? We provide support in the same manner as all other products which includes calling, emailing, and live chat. I need some accounting advice. Could you help me that? We cannot provide accounting advice as we are not certified CPAs. Does Finalsite Enrollment offer tuition insurance? Not at this time.

    "body": "Overview Billing Customers can report on their financial data at the student level and at an individual payer level via customized reports. A few canned financial reports that are available include: Click here to learn about the Payment History Report Click here to learn about the Tuition and Fees Report Click here to learn about the Financial Line Items Report Click here to learn about the Billing Accounts List Page for billing accounts and student accounts. Billing Specific Search Criteria Within the All other fields search criteria, there's a list of Billing related fields that you can search on as shown below. These fields can be used as criteria to narrow down your search and are also available as displayed columns. Student Fields Billing fields with the word 'student' will include total amounts, inclusive of all payers. This is an important point to consider when sending communications or creating reports at the student level vs at the individual billing account level, especially for a variety of household and family structures. Please note, these fields will only display amounts/data when searching on student data and statuses. Account Fields Billing fields with the word 'account' will include amounts or billing details that are specific to each individual billing account. A custom search can be built to send targeted communications to billing accounts that fit specific criteria such as overdue yes/no or to assess a late fee. Please note, these fields will only display amounts/data when searching on billing accounts. These fields will be blank or have a zero amount if displayed as columns within a student contact search. Date Based Search Criteria Certain fields allow for date based searches as shown below: Account Overdue Date Next Account Billing Date Billing Overdue At Custom Amounts Search Criteria The following fields allow you to enter custom amounts and greater than/less than or equal to ranges as shown below. Next Account Balance Current Account Balance Current Student Balance Next Student Balance Total Account Balance Total Student Balance Value Specific Search Criteria The following billing fields can be searched on with set values or options via a drop-down, or an open text field. Student Overdue: Yes/No. A value of 'yes' will display if 1 or more responsible payers is overdue. You'll need to search on billing accounts to identify what payers are overdue and which ones are current. Billing Payment Method: The payment method will display when searching on individual billing accounts, not when searching on students since it may vary across payers. Billing Autopay Enabled: Yes/No. This field will display a 'yes' value if 1 or more responsible payers has autopay enabled when searching on students. Otherwise, the value will be specific to the setup of each individual payer when searching on billing accounts. Account Overdue: Yes/No. This field value will display when searching on billing accounts and will be blank when searching on students. Billing Fields to Display as Columns Within Change/Display Columns , you can pull in a variety of Billing fields in the Search Fields section. You can search for the exact field you need by name in the search bar or you can select from the groupings to view lists of financial fields. Groups that typically contain financial information include: Billing Scholarship Tuition &amp; Fees Tuition Assistance Did you know? You can drag and drop the columns in order to rearrange the order in which they appear in the search! Once you select the fields to display in your report, you can send communications in bulk or export the data to Excel for additional reporting and financial calculations, such as entering in late fees or financial aid/scholarship/grant amounts, etc. How to Build a Search with Financially Responsible/Billing Account Contacts Within the Billing List Page &gt; Accounts tab, you can see all financially responsible contacts. If you'd like to create a custom report with your payers to identify who's overdue for example, you can set the following search criteria as shown below: All other fields -- Current Account Balance is greater than or equal to 0. Add another criteria and toggle the defaulted 'AND' statement to 'OR' between criteria as displayed below in yellow. All other fields -- Current Account Balance is less than or equal to 0. Next you can add additional fields to displayed columns in your report by clicking on change/display columns in the upper right. You can search by a field by its name , or you can search by a group or topic, like \"accounts\", to pull up a list of related fields. In the GIF (short video) below, you'll see both ways.

    "body": "Overview Schools use a variety of tools to capture experiences that happen on campus. One of these tools is Vidigami , a private social platform for teachers, students, and families to intelligently organize and share photos or videos from school. Vidigami content ties in nicely with Finalsite Enrollment communications and your Parent Portal content to personalize touchpoints even further for recruitment and to maintain relationships for retention. Recruitment: Communicate Your \"Why\" Your school has a unique story to tell. With Finalsite Enrollment communication plans and Vidigami sets, you can personalize communications to your prospective families that drive more in-depth engagement and communicate why your school is right for them. Retention Through Connection Your students created thousands of memories during the school year. Each year, you invite families to return during the re-enrollment process. This is a great opportunity to share photos with current families to remind them of the deep bond they have with your school and the community. -- How-To: Add a Vidigami Link to Finalsite Enrollment Emails There are multiple variations on adding content into an email. We suggest getting started with the basics and then expanding from there. Examples: Automated communications for inquiries based on interest. Personalized link within a re-enrollment invite. IMPORTANT NOTE: Email clients do not support embedded content or video, therefore, a text link can be used to link external content. -- Add a Vidigami Link to a Finalsite Enrollment Email Template To add a link to a Vidigami set in an email in Finalsite Enrollment: Navigate to Settings - Communication - Email Templates in Finalsite Enrollment. Type out your message in a new or existing template. Highlight a word in your message you want to hyperlink. Click the link icon in the toolbar, or type \u2318K if using a Mac. Take the direct link (not the embed link) for the Vidigami set and paste it into the 'URL' box provided. Check the ' Open in new tab ' checkbox if you want the clicked link to open in a new tab or window, instead of redirecting the parent. Click 'Insert' to finish adding the link. Save the email template. Send yourself a test email to ensure everything looks and works as expected! Create as many email templates as you need for the different interests or topics that you\u2019d like to highlight. For schools on our PRO plan, you can choose to create Automated Communication Plans to automatically send these emails based on choices the parent/student makes on the inquiry, application, or during enrollment. How-To: Add a Personalized Link to an Email Template Personalized libraries of photos can be used to highlight a student's participation at an event or a collection of memories from the entire school year. You can also personalize acceptance decisions for your applicants. How to hyperlink the merge token in the email Work with Support to have a custom text field created on your Finalsite Enrollment site to capture a personalized link per student.Make sure this field is displayed in the appropriate contact record so you can paste in a link. An example field name might be: vidigami_link_txt Go to Settings - Communication - Email templates. Type out your message in a new or existing template. Highlight a word in your message you want to hyperlink. Click the link icon in the toolbar, or type \u2318K if using a Mac. Instead of entering a link URL, type the merge token here, including the double brackets. The exact merge token will depend on the canonical name of your field. Example: #{{contact.vidigami_link_txt}}. Note: You can also locate the merge token within the merge token picker / drop-down menus of the template editor, by selecting the contact category and then the display name of the custom field. Save the email template. -- How-To: Add Personalized Links on a Contact Record If you followed the instructions above to create a custom field for personalized Vidigami links, you can now follow these steps to add the unique link for each student: Go to the student\u2019s contact record and find the field you created in the appropriate tab. Click on 'Edit Fields' and then paste the direct URL (not the embed link) for the student's Vidigami set into the custom link field. Click on 'Save Edits' to confirm the action. IMPORTANT: If you do not enter anything into the student\u2019s record, the link will not work as it will pull in blank information. One way to prevent sending a blank link is to wrap the text with a Liquid statement that will only display the text in the email if there is a link present. You can work with Support for assistance in creating this statement. For example: {% if contact.vidigami_link_txt != blank %}See your memories here .{% endif %} -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Vidigami in the Parent Portal Parent Portal Design Parent Portal Content",

    "body": "Please note: The information in this article is only relevant to schools still using the Legacy version of Stripe. If your school is using Payments, please reference this article instead for the most up-to-date information. Overview The billing cadence within Finalsite Enrollment is setup to capture payments once a month in Stripe on the billing date that's defined by your school. Monthly payments can be split across payers, as per the financial responsibility amounts that are defined in the student record. Parent's/payers may request one-time or additional payments over the phone with schools. Some families may want a bi-monthly payment cadence or they may receive a lump sum such as a tax refund that they'd like to apply. Another example of a manual payment is a grandparent that wants to contribute to their grandson/daughter's education. To support these scenarios and more, learn how to add manual payments in Stripe and record these ad-hoc transactions in Finalsite Enrollment for reporting. Search for an Existing Customer or Create New Within your Stripe Dashboard, you'll first want to check if the payer is already setup in Stripe with their saved payment information. Go to the ' Customers ' page along the far left. Click in the search bar along the top and type in the customer name. If there's no results, you'll need to create a new customer by clicking on the ' New (+) ' button in the upper right of the Customer's page. Add the contact details and create the customer. If the customer already exists, you will see their name populate in the drop down. Click on the customer name to open their account page. Add/Update Payment Information Within the customer account page, there's payment method sections where you can view credit card or bank account information that's already been saved and update/add/remove payment information via the ' + add card ' and ' + add bank account ' buttons. Create a New Payment To add a payment, scroll to the ' Payments ' section. Here you can see a history of all payments that succeeded and failed and the transaction reference ID in the ' description ' column which is displayed in your Finalsite Enrollment ' Payment History ' report. You can also add a new payment by clicking on the ' + Create payment ' button in the upper right. The ' create a new payment ' window will open. Fill out the details and finalize the transaction by clicking on the ' create payment ' button. **Important Note about Manual Payments: All manual payments must be entered in Finalsite Enrollment as there's no synching of manual payments to the payer records. Record the Payment/Transaction in Finalsite Enrollment Once the payment has been submitted in Stripe, you'll need to record this payment in the payer's record in Finalsite Enrollment. Look up the payer name in the search bar at the top of your site and click on the ' Add Payment ' button within the Billing tab . Fill out all of the payment details to match the transaction in Stripe. Click here to learn more.",

    "body": "Overview Vidigami is a private social platform for teachers, students, and families to intelligently organize and share photos or videos from school. Vidigami content ties in nicely with Finalsite Enrollment's parent portal content pages to personalize the experience for your applying or enrolling families, and boost your recruitment and retention efforts. In this article, we'll share some ideas for how to integrate your Vidigami content into the Finalsite Enrollment Parent Portal. To learn how to use Vidigami in your email communications, click here . -- How-To: Add Vidigami to the Parent Portal There are multiple Parent Portal content pages that you can add Vidigami links to: Login Page Description: Displays on the login page before the parent logs into their Parent Portal Account. Same content for all visitors. Portal Widget: Displays above the list of students when the parent logs into the Parent Portal. Same content for all visitors. Summary Page Sidebar: Displays to the side of the list of students when the parent logs into the Parent Portal. Same content for all visitors. Contact Communication Area: Displays above the checklist when a particular student is accessed. Since this area is specific per student, the content can either be the same for all visitors or personalized based on the type of student. For example, you could show different content for applying vs. enrolling students. Contact Page Sidebar: Displays to the right of the checklist when a particular student is accessed. This area can also be student-specific. NOTE: The first three options are quick and easy to configure, and should take no more than a few minutes. Personalized content within the student-specific pages is the most powerful and requires a bit more planning and consideration. -- Recommended: Add CSS to make your site responsive friendly for video Over 30% of parents engage with your school\u2019s portal via mobile devices, which means it's important to ensure content can be viewed on a variety of screens. To do this, we need to add a CSS div class to your site. Add CSS div style In your Finalsite Enrollment site, navigate to Settings - Portal - Parent Portal Design. Add the following code to the ' Custom CSS ' box, then click ' Save ' at the bottom. .video-responsive{ overflow:hidden; padding-bottom:56.25%; position:relative; height:0; } .video-responsive iframe{ left:0; top:0; height:100%; width:100%; position:absolute; } -- Add your Vidigami set to the desired Parent Portal Content page(s) To add a Vidigami set to a page, choose which content area to manage from the Parent Portal Content setup page within Settings - Portal - Parent Portal Content . 1. Click 'Edit' to the right of any template and the template editor will open. 2. Click over to the code view , indicated by the &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; button. 3. Insert the following code into the Finalsite Enrollment parent portal template and save: 4. Go to Vidigami and copy the direct link to your set, then paste it to replace SET_LINK in the code above. The result should look something like this: After editing the desired page(s), you should go to the Parent Portal and ensure the content is displaying properly.If you added it to the ' Contact Communication Area ' template, you\u2019ll need to have a test student in the portal to preview the content. IMPORTANT NOTE: The above example is code snippet, which is different than a normal iframe embed link that you get from Vidigami. The code snippet is designed to work with the custom CSS we inputted earlier. This embed link will format the content in a way that can be easily viewed on both desktops, iPads, and phone screens. ** If you use the standard Vidigami embed link, the content will display, however, it may be too large or un-viewable on a mobile device.** -- How-To: Add Personalized Vidigami Content to Student Pages It is possible to display custom content on the student-specific pages within the Parent Portal. Content could be personalized based on interests or it could be unique to the student. -- Interest-Based Content Interest-based content can highlight aspects of your school that parents are most interested to know. As you gather information during the inquiry and application process, you can focus your message on those topics. Within Settings - Portal - Parent Portal Content , you can edit the 'Contact Communication Area' or 'Contact Page Sidebar', since these are the student-specific pages. Once in the template editor, you can add a custom Liquid statement to show your Vidigami content based on the selected student interests. Example: In this example, we are showing one set of Vidigami content if the student\u2019s interest field is defined as STEM. If the student's interest field does not include STEM, then there is a default set that displays instead.This statement can be nested to create options for multiple interests. Contact support if you need help setting up your Liquid statement(s). -- Unique Per Student Content Being able to provide content that's unique to the family and student is powerful. For example, during enrollment for both new and returning families. For returning families, you can share photos from previous years with the family to remind them of the deep bond they have with your school. For new families, you can share content that makes them feel welcomed and excited to join the community. Work with support to have a custom text field created on your Finalsite Enrollment site to capture a personalized link per student. Make sure this field is displayed in the appropriate contact record so you can paste in a link. An example field name might be: vidigami_content_txt Navigate to Settings - Portal - Parent Portal Content and open one of the student-specific pages (i.e. 'Contact Communication Area' or 'Contact Page Sidebar'). Within the template, add the merge token for your custom Vidigami content field, including the double brackets. The exact merge token will depend on the canonical name of your field. Example: #{{contact.vidigami_content_txt}}. Note: You can also locate the merge token within the merge token picker / drop-down menus of the template editor, by selecting the contact category and then the display name of the custom field. Save the changes to the template. After doing this, you can go to the contact record for a test student and take the following steps to add the unique content in your custom field: Find the field you created in the appropriate tab (e.g. admissions, enrollment). Click on 'Edit Fields' and then paste the link for the student\u2019s set into the custom field. Example: &lt;div class=\"video-responsive\"&gt;&lt;iframe src=\"STUDENT_SET_LINK\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt; Go to your test student in the Parent Portal and you should see the set displayed when you click in to view their checklist. In this example, if there is no content within the field, nothing will appear. If you want to have default content appear, you\u2019ll use a code snippet with a Liquid IF statement similar to the interest example. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Vidigami in Emails Parent Portal Design Parent Portal Content",

    "body": "Overview For Stripe Legacy (non-Payments customers) and select credit union customers, Finalsite Enrollment provides an alternative and secure way to process Electronic Check withdrawals by linking to banks with the account holder's account number and routing number. We have to verify the account information via a \"micro-deposit\" process. Important: Micro-deposits are only required for the following: Schools that have not migrated to Payments (also known as Stripe Legacy). If your school is currently using Payments, then this process will only apply to families using select credit unions (see below for the list) . All other credit unions for schools using Payments will not require micro-deposits.

Please note, this list may be subject to change after this date. Not sure? Contact enrollmentsupport@finalsite.com or Click ' Help ' in the top right of your site and then select \u2018Submit a New Request.\u2019 If your school isn't currently on Payments, the team will help you get set up. Process Overview With this verification method, the parent/payer will manually input their account and routing number. This will initiate the micro-deposit process. The parent/payer will be sent a single, 0.01 USD micro-deposit. This deposit will appear on their bank statement with a unique 6-digit verification code beginning with the letters \u201cSM\u201d. This will be listed in the statement descriptor. The micro-deposit usually arrives in 1-3 business days from Stripe. Once received, the parent/payer will be notified and prompted to confirm the 6-digit verification code beginning in \u201cSM\u201d from the statement descriptor. Note: The payer should wait for the micro-deposit to hit their bank account before making any additional attempts because, if they start this process again, Stripe will send another micro-deposit (and SM code) to the payer's bank. This may cause confusion about which SM code needs to be entered. If the payer initiates this process again, the old amount and code will no longer work for verification. Parent Workflow Within the Parent Portal&gt;Billing Management tab , parents/payers will click on the ' Make a Payment ' button. Next, they will select ' electronic check ' as their payment method and then fill out their name and email address. Then click on Select Bank and Pay by Electronic Check. Then a window will pop up and the payer will select Manually Verify Instead at the bottom of the window in purple. On the next page, the payer will enter their routing and accounting number, then also confirm their accounting number, then, they will select Continue . After choosing to continue, the payer will need to wait for the micro-deposit to come through to their bank as well as the verification code. They will be notified by email when this comes through, and they will be able to use the link directly from the email to verify. IMPORTANT NOTE: Due to the transfers taking 1-3 days to appear in the payer's checking account, it is best practice for the parent/payer to go through this process at least 3 days before their payment is due. This is so that they ensure they receive the micro-deposit and confirm it before the billing date. This will eliminate the risk of a late payment being made. Enable/Disable AutoPay Parents can enable or disable autopay to save/verify payment credentials unless you have set the universal setting to require or disable autopay . The use case is that parents sometimes want to turn off autopay if they have insufficient funds, and then re-enable it with their previously saved banking credentials.

In this Article Customer Responsibilities Finalsite Enrollment Responsibilities How-To: Prepare &amp; Use the Gateway to Prep Import Template Import Options Duplicate Matching Re-using the Template Google Sheets Excel Customer Responsibilities The client will provide Finalsite Enrollment with the following items: A completed copy of the field selection document indicating which fields you would like included on your import template. A sample export of the Candidate Profile data for testing purposes. The client will self-import the file upon creation of the import template by Finalsite Enrollment Finalsite Enrollment Responsibilities Preparation of the import template. How-To: Prepare &amp; Use the Gateway to Prep Import Template The Gateway to Prep import process involves taking the CSV file provided by Gateway to Prep and processing it for import into the Finalsite Enrollment system. The Self-Service Import Tool under the Fields &amp; Data menu option allows full update and create functionality. To prepare the template, follow these instructions: Copy and paste the Candidate Profile data exported from GTP into the source_edit sheet of the GTP Import Template. Note: If there is data in this sheet from a previous import, do not delete the rows as this will break the formulas in the import sheet. Instead, you will want to highlight the rows and hit the \u2018delete\u2019 key on your keyboard or highlight the rows, right-click, and select the \u2018clear rows\u2019 option within Google Sheets. Click on the import sheet. You will now need to download this sheet as a CSV. To do this, go to File -&gt; Download -&gt; Comma-separated values . Once downloaded, it is best to not open and resave in Excel. This is because Excel automatically converts special characters within a CSV. Navigate to your Import Data Page in Finalsite Enrollment under Settings \u2192 Fields and Data \u2192 Data Import . Import Options In the Validate an Import window within Finalsite Enrollment, you will want to select the options listed below. For detailed instructions on how to use the Import Data Tool in Finalsite Enrollment, Import Data - Click 'Choose File' to select the saved. CSV file from your computer that you want to import. Import Mode - Choose 'Create' to create these new contacts in the system. Import Description - Description of what you are importing. Being specific in your description is helpful so that you can easily locate a certain import later on. Dry Run - Check this box to run your import as a dry run test to see if everything will be imported without errors. No data will be created or updated when you perform a dry run. You will need to rerun the import without this option selected to create or update the data. Use Mapping Template - Leave Blank Run With Duplicate Matching - Leave Blank Validate Button - Click here to run the import validation. You will receive an email when the import either stops due to errors or is completed successfully. You can wait and refresh the page to see the status or come back to the page later. Please note : Depending on how many students are on the import file, the import could take up to an hour to complete in Finalsite Enrollment. Duplicate Matching Once the import is successfully imported, you will need to merge all duplicate households and contacts. Detailed instructions on how to do this can be found via the links below: Duplicate Household Matching Instructions Duplicate Contact Matching Instructions Re-using the Template Because each cell on the \u201cImport\u201d tab of the template contains a formula, you never want to delete data from this tab. Google Sheets To prepare the template to be re-used for the next import, simply go to the source_edit tab and highlight all columns with data (exclude the headers), and hit the delete key on your keyboard. Instead of hitting the delete key, another option is to right-click and select the \u2018clear rows\u2019 option. Excel To prepare the template to be re-used for the next import, simply go to the source_edit tab and highlight all columns with data (exclude the headers) and go to Edit \u2192 Clear \u2192 Contents. If you have a different version of Excel, this may look different. Now the template is ready to be used for your next group of students! Simply repeat the steps above for a new import.",

    "body": "Overview Finalsite Enrollment provides Single Sign-On (SSO) support for SystemAdmin, Admin, User, and Limited User accounts in schools using Google and Microsoft services. SSO enables the school to leverage a trusted external site for user verification. One significant advantage of SSO is a decrease in login troubleshooting and the convenience of logging in from various devices when necessary. Parent SSO SSO is automatically available to all parents when they log in. Utilizing SSO on the admin side does require additional internal setup (outlined below), but, on the parent end, there's nothing to turn on or enable, it's automatically available to your parents. For more info on the parent login experience, please refer to our Overview of Parent Login Options: Manual Account Creation and SSO article. In this Article Setup Signing in Important Behaviors of SSO Setup To set up SSO, navigate to Settings &gt; Portal &gt; OAuth Configuration. Who can access this page? Admin Account Types: System Admins Permissions: Any Note: You can hover on the \" i \" for each of these settings to learn more. Required for admins: Select either Google or Microsoft from the dropdown. This is a global setting that will require SSO for any admin with a Finalsite Enrollment account to log in. If all users do not have a G-suite account, you'll leave this dropdown blank. Allowed Domains: This is where you'll include the domain of your school's G-Suite or Microsoft account. Type in the name of your domain and select ' create option' as shown below. The domain will be added to the allowed domain list. If there are multiple domains across campuses or school levels, you can add multiple domains. Once the domain(s) have been added, Click Submit to save the configuration. Signing In Signing in with Google SSO On the Admin Sign-In page, the email address and password fields will be replaced with the message and button below. Once you click on the ' Sign in with Google ' button, you'll be prompted to select the Google account you'd like to use. Click on the account and if your authentication is successful, you'll be logged in and a success message will display at the top of the page. If the login fails, you will see a red error message. Signing in with Microsoft SSO On the Admin Sign-In page, the email address and password fields will be replaced with the message and button below. Once you select the Sign in button, you'll be prompted to select your account. Keep in mind: First-time users may see a pop-up that asks them to confirm that they would like to use SSO before they log in. Once it's approved, it should not show again. That pop-up looks like this: Once you select your account, if your authentication is successful, you'll be logged in and a success message will display at the top of the page. If the login fails, you will see a red error message. Important Behaviors of SSO In order to use this, you need to have enabled Google G-Suite or Microsoft for all staff accounts. Please note, this is different than personal email accounts. Admin Portal Accounts need to be created/exist for SSO permission to be granted. If a user cannot log in, they will see an error message displayed if a Finalsite Enrollment account doesn't exist for them. You will also be notified of the domain(s) you\u2019ll need to sign in with if you use the wrong one. If a System Admin/Admin/User/Limited User account is removed in G-Suite or Microsoft, that same Admin/User will not be able to log into Finalsite Enrollment. Their account will still exist within Finalsite Enrollment, however, the log-in will no longer work. If the SSO is turned off, inform your users in advance so they can reset their passwords. Session time-out is set to 2 weeks.",

Within this report, you can view the details of all billing accounts including payment methods, overdue accounts, upcoming payments, remaining balances, and current balance amounts. In This Article About the Accounts Page At-a-Glance Export, Communicate, and Edit Export Menu Adding Charges or Credits in Bulk (Edit Menu) Emailing Accounts (Communicate Menu) Totals Box and Columns Filter Options Active/Inactive Accounts About the Accounts Page At-a-Glance The Accounts List page is a summary view of data on a parent-by-parent basis. You can use the Edit menu to add account-level charges or credits and the page can be filtered in a variety of ways through the Filter Options menu. Export, Communicate, and Edit Once you select one or more of the Accounts, the Edit, Communicate, and Export menus become available. Export Menu The report can be exported to a CSV or PDF through the Export menu. Emailing Accounts (Communicate Menu) Once you select one or more of the Accounts, the Edit and Communicate menus become available. You can use the Communicate menu to email the accounts you've selected. You may find it particularly useful to use this in combination with the filter options. For example, you can filter the report to show only families that have Autopay enabled in case you'd like to email them. Emailing from this page works the same as it does from any other page or report. Here's what you'll select: Recipient: choose whether to send this to every contact in the list or send a family-based email. Sending \"family-based\" emails will send the communication once per family to the primary parent or guardian rather than duplicating the message and sending it to every parent/guardian in a family. Timing: Either send the email right away or schedule it to be sent later. Remember, scheduled emails can be found under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Scheduled Emails. Also good to note, scheduled emails get locked in about an hour before they are sent so be sure to check them before them to make sure you are ready to have them sent out. Crafting the message: Finally, you'll be able to either write up a message from scratch or select one of your custom email templates to send. After previewing your email, hit the Submit button to send (or schedule) the email! Here's a peek at what that looks like: Edit Menu You can use the Edit menu to add charges and credits to any of the accounts on this page individually, or in bulk. Once added, the charge will appear on the parent/payer's ledger and will also be visible on the parent end. Important: Only account-level charges/credits can be added. Account-level charges are charges that are not applied to the student, but, rather, applied at the account or payer level. Common examples of account-level charges are Late Fees and NSF fees. On the \u2018Billing Categories\u2019 page, these fees will not have the \u2018Apply to Student Balance\u2019 box checked off. You can read more about Billing Categories, within our Billing Categories article. You can read about automating late fees in our Billing Setup article. Adding Charges or Credits in Bulk Select one or more accounts from the list. Select Edit Select Add Charge or Add Credit Enter the details of the charge or credit within the details pop-up box. The charge details pop-up box: Ledger Lock Note The Ledger Lock lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on or before the set date. If you are utilizing the Ledger Lock feature, you will not be able to add charges or credits to apply during the locked period. This feature can be adjusted on the Billing Setup Page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). Read more about Ledger Lock and how it affects other areas of your site in our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. Totals Box and Columns Totals Box The grey box above the list sums up the list totals into three different groups: Next Amount: Displays the total sum of the Account charges that are due in the next billing cycle. Remaining Amount: Shows the total sum of any upcoming charges and any unpaid tuition. Current Amount: Displays the total sum of the balances that are due as of today. Columns The column headers, located at the top of the list, provide descriptions for the data within each corresponding column. To organize the list, you can click on the triangle icons adjacent to most headers, allowing you to sort based on those specific column attributes. Name (sortable): All accounts are listed by the parent/payer name. Autopay (sortable): The checkmark indicates that the payment information is saved and stored in Stripe. Please note: payment information is NEVER stored in Finalsite Enrollment. It\u2019s passed over to Stripe from SA via the browser to indicate if the account is on Autopay. Payment Method (sortable): Indicates a credit card or electronic check. Overdue Date (sortable): This will show the date the account became overdue, according to the grace period set by your school (if applicable) and in parenthesis how long it has been overdue. If the account is overdue, a red triangle will display under the current balance column along the far right as shown below. Next Date: Shows the due date for the next amount column. The date will change over to the next month on the billing day. Next Amount (sortable): Displays the amount due on the next billing cycle, including any deferred charges. This column will update to the next amount due in the billing cycle on the billing day. Remaining Balance (sortable): Shows the total of any upcoming charges and any unpaid tuition. Current Balance (sortable): Displays the current balance that's due as of today. This is consistent with the amounts in the Ledger of the payer record and the amount reflected in the Parent Portal for the payer. If the account is overdue, based on the grace period (if one is set), there will be a red triangle with an exclamation point to flag the account as overdue (see the example above). Autopay Billing Days (sortable): Displays the account's Billing Date(s) . Actions: This column allows you to Activate or Inactivate Billing accounts. You can only inactivate Billing accounts that have a zero balance. For more in-depth info on Active and Inactive billing accounts, please refer to the Active/Inactive Accounts section of this article. Filter Options When you expand the Filter Options menu, you can filter the list in the following ways: Billing Account Active: Yes: Only displays active billing accounts. The list automatically defaults to show only active billing accounts. No: Only displays inactive billing accounts. Billing Autopay Enabled: Yes: Only displays the accounts with autopay enabled. No: Only displays the accounts that do not have autopay enabled. Account Overdue: Yes: Only displays overdue accounts. No: Only displays current accounts. Billing Payment Method: Text box to search by Billing Payment Method. If you enter the exact payment method, it will filter the report to only show payers who have that method set as their autopay method. Custom Filters Our team can add custom filters to your Billing Reports. In the example image above, you can see that we've added the International Student field as a custom filter. To request custom filters, contact our Support team . Active/Inactive Accounts The Accounts List page includes a way to mark accounts as inactive. This provides a way to manage the list on the page so that only relevant accounts are displayed. How does this help? Designating accounts of families who have withdrawn from your school or exhibit limited billing activity as \"inactive\" enables you to maintain more concise and streamlined data. This approach enhances your ability to effectively monitor accounts with increased efficiency. How are accounts inactivated? Accounts are inactivated either manually or automatically. Manual : Any account with a zero balance can be manually marked as inactive. Please note that this means that if the account has any balance, regardless of whether the balance is positive or negative, the account can not be inactivated. Automatic: If the account meets all of the following criteria, it will be automatically marked as inactive by the system. Zero Balance. The account must have a zero balance. If the account has any balance (positive or negative), it will not be marked as inactive. Ledger Activity. The account can not have charges on the ledger for the current term or future terms. Even if the account has a zero balance, if there are charges on the ledger in the current term or any future term, it will not meet the criteria to be automatically marked as inactive by the system. One Year. The account must have had no ledger activity for one calendar year. How do you manually mark an account as inactive? Click on the Make Inactive link in the Actions column to mark an account as inactive. If it does not meet the criteria to be manually marked as inactive (having a zero balance), you will not be able to mark it as inactive and an error message will display. Once you mark an account as inactive, when you filter to show only active accounts, the account will not display within the list. How do they become active again? Manual: Once you've filtered the Accounts page to see your Inactive accounts, click the Make Active link in the Actions column to make an account active. Automatic: Inactive accounts will automatically become active again if there is any activity on the ledger (payment/charge/credit). Once active, the account will reappear in the list on the Accounts page when filtered to show active accounts. Does inactivating an account affect anything else on your site? No, accounts that are marked as inactive do not affect any other part of your site. It does not affect the payer ledgers or any of the reports. Inactivating accounts only affects data management on the Accounts page.

In this article Selecting Students Terms Filter Filter Options Export, Communicate, Edit Export Menu Communicate Menu Edit Menu: Adding Charges/Credits in Bulk Add Charge Add Credit Columns Columns within the Report Custom Columns Ledger Lock Note Selecting Students By default all contacts are deselected. Hover to the left of a name to select one student, or select the checkbox to the left of Name to select all students. Uncheck the box to deselect a student. Once deselected the contact's checkbox will disappear but will reappear when hovered over again. Terms Filter Set the term/school year of students you'd like to view from the drop-down menu. Filter Options Filter options allow you to drill down on student balances by grade level and overdue status. Select your options and then click ' Apply Filters .' Important Note: The Student Overview filter option will be set to 'yes' if 1 or more billing accounts are overdue. This page will not show you which billing accounts are overdue, and should not be used for overdue account communications. Export, Communicate, Edit Export Menu The report can be exported to a CSV or PDF through the Export menu. Communicate Menu To bulk email families from this page, use your filter options or select students as needed and then click on the ' Communicate ' menu in the upper right. Click here to learn more. *Important Note about Multiple Billing Accounts and Delinquency Communications: If you need to send an email ONLY to billing accounts/payers that are overdue or any other account level criteria, you'll need to create a filtered search within the 'Search &amp; Reports' tab for overdue or delinquent accounts. Sending an email within this page to 'Student Overdue' is 'yes' will email all responsible payers, where only one of them might be overdue, not both since this page doesn't drill down on billing accounts. Edit Menu: Adding Charges/Credits in Bulk To add a charge or credit to student accounts in bulk, click on the ' Edit ' menu in the upper right of the ' Students ' page. *IMPORTANT NOTE: All students are selected in bulk across ALL pages of students by default. This means that if you have 4 pages of students, all 4 pages of students are selected, which means you do not need to add a charge or credit to each page of students. If you'd like to select students manually, mark the checkboxes of the student accounts you need. Once you click on the ' Edit ' menu, the drop-down menu will display two options: Add Charge Add Credit Add a Charge To add a charge in bulk to the selected contacts, you will be asked to fill out the following information: Date: The date the charge is being applied to the account. Category: All current billing categories in your site will be available in the drop-down menu. Select the category that this charge should be assigned to. Description: Type a description of the charge. Amount: Enter the amount of the charge. Click ' Submit ' to apply the charge. Add a Credit To add a credit in bulk, you will be asked to fill out the following: Date: The date the credit is being applied to the account. Category: All current billing categories in your site will be available in the drop-down menu. Select the category that this credit should be assigned to. Description: Type a description of the credit. Amount: Enter the amount of the credit. Click ' Submit ' to apply the credit. Columns Columns within the report Name (sortable): The name of the enrolled student. Payment Plan (sortable): Shows the payment plan selection. Grade (sortable): The current grade of the student. Custom Columns (if set): Any custom columns that have been set within the 'List Page Configuration' page will display to the right of the 'grade' column. There are two in the example above.

Remaining (sortable): Shows the total of any upcoming charges and any unpaid tuition. Current Balance (sortable): Shows any unpaid charges that have been due or are currently due. Custom Columns You can add up to 5 custom columns to this report, which will display to the right of the ' Grade ' column. The examples above include ' Boarding? ' and ' External ID .' Some schools want to add charges or credits in bulk according to student ID's, programs such as day/boarding/daycare/afterschool, and more which makes this customization useful. Click here to learn how. Ledger Lock Note The Ledger Lock lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on or before the set date. If you are utilizing the Ledger Lock feature, you will not be able to add charges or credits to apply during the locked period.

    "body": "Overview Under Settings &gt; Billing &gt; AR Aging Report , schools can easily manage a history of what accounts are/have been overdue, amounts overdue, and who is net 30, 60, or 90+ days overdue. This report will show all payers with a non-zero balance and the students the payers are responsible for. A note about Autopay and the AR Aging Report Because an account with multiple autopay dates is not considered overdue until the last autopay date of the month has passed, the AR Aging report treats all items associated with an installment as if they were posted on the latest item's posting date within the same account and installment. For example, if a payer's autopay dates are the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd, they will be considered as if they were all posted on the 22nd within the AR Aging report. Therefore, they won't be considered past due/show up in the AR Aging report until the 22nd has passed (taking any grace period and threshold into consideration as well). AR Aging Report Options Date Picker Within the date picker at the top left side of the page, you can search on historical dates which will show who had a balance at that point in time even if they do not currently have a balance. It also means the payer does not have to be currently overdue to appear on the report. For example, consider an account that is current as of today, but was overdue two months ago. If you search on a date that was two months ago, the account will be flagged overdue as of that past date, even though the account is no longer overdue today. Filter Options If you want to filter the report by term(s) [or no term], grade(s), account balance, or any custom fields, you can do this using the ' Filter options' in the top left, under the date picker. Click on ' filter options ' to expand the options, and then check off the term(s), grade(s), account balance, or custom filter options (such as Program in this example) you want to apply. This is a multi-select field, so you can choose more than one option for each field to filter by if needed. Please note: the Filter Options default to filter the results of the report to show only those with a positive account balance but you can use the filter options menu to opt to filter by different account balance criteria, such as Negative Balance or Zero Balance. Once you have selected the criteria you want, click on ' Apply Filters'. To return to the default view (i.e. showing all terms), click on the ' Clear Filters' button. Custom Filter Options: If you need any custom filter options brought into this report or other billing reports, contact our support team and let us know which field(s) you\u2019d like added in. Please note, ID fields and text fields cannot be used as filter options. Read the 'Export' section below to learn more about how to display ID fields in your export file. Export By selecting the \u2018 Export \u2019 menu in the top right of the page, you can either export the data to a CSV file or download a pdf of the report. The exported file will contain the following columns: Account Name Student Name I D fields (Depends on your school's setup) If you have any ID Fields in Finalsite Enrollment (ex. IDs related to your SIS or integrations), these may pull into the report. If you're not sure what ID fields you have set up for your exports, or if the field is displayed as a column with no values, please contact enrollmentsupport@finalsite.com so they can assist you. Term: The current term/school year that the student is in Total: The total amount that's currently overdue Overdue Timeframes: The total overdue amount will display according to the timeframes displayed within the report. Edit By selecting the \u2018 Edit \u2019 menu in the top right of the page, you can add charges or credits in bulk or to individual payers on this report. Important: Only account-level charges/credits can be added. Account-level charges are charges that are not applied to the student, but, rather, applied at the account or payer level. Common examples of account-level charges are Late Fees and NSF fees. On the \u2018Billing Categories\u2019 page, these fees will not have the \u2018Apply to Student Balance\u2019 box checked off. You can read more about Billing Categories, within our Billing Categories article. You can read about automating late fees in our Billing Setup article. How-To Select one or more accounts by hovering to the left of the name. Or, select the entire page by clicking the top box to the left of the 'Name' column. Click ' Edit. ' Select either ' Add Charge ' or ' Add Credit. ' Enter the following information in the 'Charge Details' dialogue box: Date Category You will only be able to select account-level categories. If you do not see any Billing Categories available in the dropdown it means you do not have any set to apply only at the account level. Check your billing categories (Setting &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories) and contact support if you need further help. Description This will appear on the ledger. The best practice would be to add a clear and concise description. The description is also seen on the parent side. Amount You do not need to enter any dollar sign here, just the value of the charge (i.e 10.50 or 20). Click ' Submit. ' Once you add the charges or credits, you can navigate to the payer's ledger to view them. If they do not appear immediately, give it a few seconds and refresh the page and you should see them listed. Ledger Lock Note The Ledger Lock lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on or before the set date. If you are utilizing the Ledger Lock feature, you will not be able to add charges or credits to apply during the locked period. This feature can be adjusted on the Billing Setup Page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). Read more about Ledger Lock and how it affects other areas of your site in our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. Totals Summary Along the top of the AR Aging Report is a summary of the total amount that is overdue on all accounts and a breakdown of overdue totals according to the following date ranges: 0-30 Days 31-60 Days 61-90 Days 91+ Days List Page Columns The columns contain the following information: Account Last Name: Last name for the billing account. Account First Name: First name for the billing account. Account Middle Name: Middle name for the billing account. The \u2018Account\u2019 name is the name of the parent/guardian who is responsible for the billing of a student. Student Last Name: The last name of the student connected to the billing account. Student First Name: The first name of the student connected to the billing account. Student Middle Name: The middle name of the student connected to the billing account. Term: The term that the outstanding balance is owed in. A student may have an outstanding balance in more than one term. If they do, you will see a row in the report for each term that has an outstanding balance for the connected student. See the image below for an example: Total: Total overdue amount for the billing account. See the section below for more information on the breakdown of the displayed totals. Date Ranges: The remaining columns contain the dollar amounts that are overdue within 30 days, 31-60 days, 61-90 days, and any amounts overdue past 90 days. All of these columns are sortable. Simply click on the name of the column to sort the list in ascending or descending order. Understanding the breakdown of the report: First Line: Total outstanding account balance for the parent/payer listed. Second Line: If applicable, any parent/payer fees such as an NSF fee or a late fee will display Please note : Parent fees will not show when you filter this report by term because account-level fees are not term-based. Following Line(s): Once all applicable parent fees are listed, all student balances will be listed below for any term that is currently overdue on the date set. Parent/Payer Fees vs Student Fees Parent/Payer Fees (also known as account-level fees) include any fees that apply to parents or payers, not students. A good example of this would be a late fee or NSF fee. Student Fees include tuition and other required/optional fees. In your billing categories, this is everything that is assigned to the student balance. Click here to read more!

    "body": "Overview It's smart to have a test student or two in your Finalsite Enrollment system. This helps you see things from a parent's perspective and assist families. This guide will show you how to set up a test student and authenticate as a parent of the student to test the Parent Portal. In this Article Create a New Test Student Locating Your New Test Student Authenticating to Your Test Student Specific Areas &amp; Items to Test Best Practices Create a New Test Student If you don't already have a test student to use, or you want to start from scratch with one, you can follow these steps to create a test student (and associated parent) in your Finalsite Enrollment site. 1. From the Quick Action menu, select Fill out an Application form. 2. Within the form, enter the following information: (all other parts of the form are optional when adding a student this way) Student First Name and Last Name. Important: If you are adding a test student, be sure to use the word \"Test\" as either the first or last name so that later it will be easier to locate your test students. Student Grade Student Term (the year that they are applying for) Name of 1 parent (first and last) Quick note: If you are using our Text Messaging feature, you'll also need to Opt in or Out out order to submit the form. You don't need to enter a number :) Just select \"yes\" or \"no\". 3. Click Submit Et voil\u00e0...you have successfully added a new student to your site! \ud83e\udd73 Locating your New Test Student You can find the student by searching for their name in the search bar or locating them in the Forms Inbox. Option 1: Using the search bar. Type the test student's name in the search bar at the top right of the page. Select their name to navigate to their record. Option 2: Forms Inbox If you don't see their name when you type it into the search bar, you may need to locate them in the Forms Inbox. Access your Forms Inbox from your Username Menu &gt; Forms to Import Or within your Admissions tab &gt; Forms If your test student is in the Forms Inbox, you'll need to click the import button to import them first. If they are not in the inbox, you'll see them in the Recently Imported tab of the Forms Inbox. If you see them in the Recently Imported forms tab of the Forms Inbox , you can click on their name and it will take you to their record. Authenticate to your Test Student 1. Navigate to the student's record. As mentioned above, once you've imported them, you will see them in your Forms Inbox on the Recently Imported tab. You can also search for them by name in the search bar at the top of the page. From the student's record, navigate to the Portal Accounts page. Click the computer icon on the right side of the page to get to the Portal Accounts page. 2. Copy the authentication code for your test parent under the Code column. You will use this to authenticate to the test student. Important: Be sure to copy the parent code, not the student's. 3. Navigate to your Finalsite Enrollment Parent Portal. Click on your name in the upper right and select Parent Portal from the drop-down menu. You will automatically be brought to the Parent Portal. 4. Select the enter authentication code option. 5. Paste the authentication code into the pop-up box. Make sure there are no extra spaces at the beginning or end of the code. Select Next to continue. If the authentication is successful, you should see a green banner with the message \"Your account has been authenticated\" displayed at the top of the page. You will also now see your test student in the students list on the Parent Portal. If you do not see them here, make sure you changed their status from Inquiry to an Applicant/Enrollment status on the Admin side. How do I get back to the Admin Portal from here? Erase \"/portal\" at the end of the URL and replace it with \"/admin\". Like this... Specific Areas &amp; Items to Test Below is a list of some specific areas or items to review when you are testing the Parent Portal experience. Checklist Setup: Is there clear Parent Explanation text for checklist items to clarify what a family needs to do for an item to be marked complete? Is each item appropriately marked as required, optional, or internal? Reminder: Checklist items marked as Internal will not be visible in the parent portal. You can read more about visibility settings in the Checklist Overview article. Online Forms &amp; File Uploads: Do all online forms look and behave as expected? Be sure to test any field dependencies, as well as check that any merge fields are pulling the correct information. Do all file uploads work and accept the correct number of files (i.e. single vs. multi-file upload )? Calendars &amp; Events: Do all event checklist items and/or forms that have event registrations on them have available time slots to book? Do all event checklist items have the appropriate Calendar Access Settings configured? Check that parents/students can book themselves for events or cancel/reschedule appointments as appropriate. Please note: You will not receive a notification for canceled or rescheduled appointments. General Settings: Do you have a contact name and phone number in your Login Page Description in case parents have trouble logging into the portal? Are you using the Contact Communication Area to communicate important deadlines or include key links (e.g. to your website or school calendar)? Is your school's Contact Information up to date? Did you know? If you want to preview the experience of an exact parent, you should use the Impersonate feature. The Impersonate feature gives users the ability to mimic the login session of a parent and view their Parent Portal the same way that the parent views it. This can be helpful in troubleshooting problems and having better context of the parent\u2019s perspective while using Finalsite Enrollment. Best Practices If you keep the test student in your current workflow, make sure you remember what status they are in so that you can reduce your counts by one for any reports you create or present to your board. If you would like to move the test student out of your current workflow for the reason above, you can change their term (using the 'Move' option, not 'Copy') and move them back when needed. You can also change their status to see different Parent Portal views between active and inactive statuses or admission and enrollment statuses.

When the enrollment year has finished setting up, you can click on the ' activate ' text in the ' Enrollment Year Status ' column. Again, you will be asked to confirm the action. After confirming the action, you'll see an ' Activating (reload to check status) ' message as shown below. Click on the ' reload ' text or refresh your page to check the status. You can confirm your new enrollment year is set up and activated by a 'YES' value in the 'Enrollment Year Created?' column and an 'Active' value in the 'Enrollment Year Status' column, both displaying in BOLD text. Now, you will have access to edit items in the new enrollment year, as well as move students into that year! Rename Contract or Deposit On the Enrollment Setup page, you can also edit the Contract Name or Deposit Name from within the Contract Settings section of the page. Contract Name: The contract name displays in the top left corner of each page of the contract as shown below. This is displayed to your families as they complete the form, so rename it to whatever makes sense to your school's process. For example, some schools prefer to call this a Registration Form. Deposit Name: The deposit name displays on the contract under the 'Totals Summary' field/section as shown below. In our example, we have renamed it to Registration Fee. Enable Contact Photos on Contracts Below the Contract name and Deposit name text is an option to enable the most recent contact photo for students on the PDF of the contract. Check the box and then click on the 'Save' button at the bottom of the page. Require Countersignatures For schools that require countersignatures on contracts, you can enable this feature with two signature options: Default Option (Not Displayed in this page): Add digital signature Choose File: Upload an image of a signature. Limited to one image, which may contain multiple signatures within the image. Check the box to require a countersignature either at the pending payment state or submitted state. If you prefer to upload an image instead of using the default digital signature, click on the 'Choose File' button. The image used will be displayed. Continuous Enrollment For schools that use Continuous Enrollment or Evergreen Contracts, you can enable this feature to rollover contracts year to year and bulk submit them within the Enrollment List Page. Check the box and click 'Save.'

    "body": "Overview Schools often need to import a .CSV file of ancillary transactions such as charges, credits, or payments. Read below for details on importing billing transactions in Finalsite Enrollment. Pro Tip Did you know that you can quickly add charges in bulk through the Accounts and Students list pages? These reports are located under the Billing menu. For simple adds, this may be the best solution for you. Pop some Popcorn! If you'd prefer to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library. Export as a Billing Template Create a Search To get started, you'll need an export file to record all of the financial data you need to import. Within the ' Search &amp; Reports' page, you can create a search of your currently enrolled students similar to the example below. Please note, some schools use a status of 'Enrollment in Progress' with 'completed checklist item (s)' criteria of contract and deposit if they have additional items that need to be completed on the checklist before the automated status change to enrolled. Otherwise, you can simply use the status of 'enrolled.' -- Export as a Billing Import Template Then click on Export &gt; Export as a Billing Import Template . Billing Import Template Fields Fields that are Pre-Filled by the System The Billing import template includes 'child' and 'billing contact/account' fields that are pre-filled as explained below. Please Note The id fields (child id and billing account id) are required for a successful import. Please do not remove those when editing the import file. Child Related Fields CHILD.id CHILD.first_name CHILD.middle_name CHILD.last_name CHILD.grade: The current grade that the child is enrolling in. CHILD.school_year: The current term that the child is enrolling in. BILLING_CONTACT.payment_plan: The payment plan selected in the child's submitted contract. Billing Account Fields BILLING_ACCOUNT.id BILLING_ACCOUNT.split: The financial split percentage for the billing account/payer. BILLING_ACCOUNT.first_name BILLING_ACCOUNT.middle_name BILLING_ACCOUNT.last_name BILLING_ACCOUNT.next_account_billing_date: This date is based on the student\u2019s billing date and is auto-filled. It should not be edited . Fields that are required Certain fields are required on the import template. The import will not be possible without adding data to these fields. Import Fields Required to be set by the School IMPORT.billing_category: Type in the billing category name you want the charge/credit/payment assigned. IMPORTANT: Billing categories are case-sensitive and need to match the exact capitalization in your billing categories setup page. IMPORT.billing_type: Indicate if this is a charge, credit, or payment. IMPORT.amount: Type in the dollar amount of the line item. The $ sign does not need to be included. Credits and payments need to have a negative (-) sign in front of the amount to be credited. Spreading Charges Across Payment Plans Please note that you can't spread charges across a payment plan after importing. If you need to accomplish this, you'll need to have multiple, separate charges added to the import template, each with its own specific posting date. For Example, you have a $1k charge that needs to be spread across 10 months ($100 per month for 10 months). In order to do this, add 10, separate charges of $100 to the import template, each with a specific posting date. IMPORT.posted_date: Posted Date is the date the charge will apply and display on the ledger. Please note, this isn't necessarily the same as the billing date, which is the payer's due date. For example, If I add a posting date of 1/5 (January 5th), and the payer's next billing date is February 2nd, this payer won't be making any payments until 2/2. This means the payer doesn't owe anything on January 3rd, nor are they overdue on the 3rd since the posted date is after the January billing date and before the February billing date. Important Note: The date MUST follow the same format that your school is set up to be. E.g. If your school is located in Canada, the date format would be DD/MM/YYYY as opposed to the American date format, which is MM/DD/YYYY. By default, the year will be in the 'yy' format. If you skip this step, your import/validation will fail with an error that the posting date is invalid. IMPORT.description: Provide a description of the line item for your ledger. Note regarding adding amounts: It\u2019s only necessary to use a negative sign (example -10) within the IMPORT.amount column when: Reversing a charge (negative charge) Adding a payment Adding a credit When you are reversing a payment or credit, or adding a regular charge, you do not need to proceed the amount by a negative sign. Example Import file snippet, demonstrating how to add each type of update: Example Ledger showing the result of the import: Import a file Please Use Caution When Importing Before importing please note that you can not delete or change imported charges/payments/credits in bulk. Fixing incorrect imports requires either: Manual deletion of every incorrect charge/credit/payment individually via the parent's ledger. Or, uploading another template with a negative charge to zero out the incorrect charges. Additional note on this option: The parent ledger will show both the original (incorrect) charge and the negative charge used to zero it out. To import a .csv file, click on ' Billing' &gt; ' Import .' Then click on the blue ' Import Billing Transactions ' button in the upper left. If you ever need to refresh the list, click on ' Reload .' Next, you'll need to choose the file for import and set a few criteria. Choose file: Click here to upload the .csv file from your computer. Description: Type a description of the line items you're importing Validate Only?: Check this box if you prefer to test the file before importing. Submit Import: This button will either submit the validation if this option was checked or it will run the import process. Once you submit the import/validation, you'll see the following columns: User: The email address of the user that imported the file or that ran the validation. Date/Time: The date and time that the file was imported or that the validation was run. Duration: The amount of time it took for the file to import or for the validation to run. Description: This is the description you define for the import file. Uploaded File: Displays the name of the .csv file you import/validate Import Status: Indicates if the import/validation succeeded or failed. View: You'll see different messaging based on the success or failure of a validation/import. A failed import/validation will display a list of errors. If the import file is validated successfully , you will see a confirmation message as shown below. If the import succeeded and the ledger entries were created, you will see the details of the imported data per billing account as shown below. You can now see all of the imported transactions reflected in the associated account ledgers. For this example, the book fee we imported is now the most recent transaction that was added to the ledger based on the date.

    "body": "Overview This article provides information related to the Deposit that's tailored to those who use our Billing module. We also have a Deposit article that contains more information about managing deposits, editing the deposit language on the contract, overriding the deposit, and more. Be sure to check that one out too when you are learning about Deposits. Vocab Desposit vs Registration Fee A sum of money that a parent/guardian is required to pay to secure a place for their child at school. Deposit is how this item is referred to throughout the Finalsite Enrollment system; however, you may call this the Registration Fee , Enrollment Fee, or anything else that works for your school. In this article Deposit Scenarios Deposit Checklist Items Contract Fees With \"Add To Deposit\" Enabled Deposit Billing Category Fee Allocation Deposit Scenarios Scenario 1 If no financial split is assigned prior to contract submission, whichever parent signs the contract and pays the deposit will have their ledger populated with the deposit charge and payment as well as the payment plan. Scenario 2 If a parent is assigned a 100% financial split before the contract is submitted, that parent's ledger will populate with the deposit change and payment as well as the payment plan (even if the other parent signs the contract and pays the deposit on the contract). Scenario 3 In the scenario when there is a 0% payer making a deposit payment, and there are two billing additional accounts split at 50% / 50%, our system will use the date and time that a billing account was created to distinguish which account the deposit charge and payment gets applied to. Example: In this example, there are 3 parents/guardians: Parent 1 is assigned 0%, Parent 2 is assigned 50% and Parent 3 is assigned 50%. For this use case, the deposit charge will go to the oldest responsible payer in regards to when they were added to the system. So if payer_a was created on 1/1/20 and payer_b was created on 1/2/20, the deposit charge will go to payer_a. There are other features on the site that affect the behavior of the deposit. If you are using these features we recommend reviewing the following resources to understand how it affects the deposit: Continuous Enrollment Dual Signature Split Contracts This article also contains details on the following scenarios: Split Contracts with Continuous Enrollment Split Contracts with Dual Signature Deposit Checklist Items Please note: You can attempt to fix most deposit issues (deposit payment showing in the incorrect category, missing deposit payment on the ledger, etc.) by unchecking and then rechecking the Deposit checklist item and entering the details of the Payment within the dialogue box . If you are unsure if this is the correct path forward to resolve your issue or are in need of further assistance, please reach out to our support team for further guidance. Along with deposits made through the parent portal, the student checklist also provides a way of acknowledging a deposit has been received when accepting cash, checks, or in person payments. Whoever is adding the manual deposit, needs to enter an amount, a payment method, a billing account, and a date. Once those fields are inputed, that deposit payment will show up on the billing account you entered. Note: If that payment later fails, the charge will automatically get added back to the ledger and the account, but an admin will need to go and uncheck that deposit checklist item. Contract Fees With \"Add To Deposit\" Enabled A note about payment methods The payment methods chosen on the Deposit Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Deposit) determines the payment options available to parents on their contract and, for schools utilizing our Billing module, within their Billing Management tab. Any contract fee with A dd To Deposit enabled, will post to the ledger as one deposit line item. Example: If you have a contract fee of $1000 deposit for tuition and another contract fee for the payment plan of $50 that has been added to the deposit. If a contract fee is not added to deposit, it will be spread across the payment plan. Anything posted after the deposit will be net tuition amount on the ledger. If the deposit is larger than the total of the contract, we post the remaining amount to the ledger. For immediate payment plans (one where the total of the contract is due at once), we don\u2019t post any deposit line items and never post a deposit charge--instead we just post one tuition ledger item with everything from the contract in it (and the payment item, assuming they paid as soon as they submitted the contract). For Immediate plans only: This will also post on the payer\u2019s billing date, so if they are submitting an immediate plan today 1/22/20, but their billing date was the 15th, we will show one tuition ledger item on the 15th with all the line items from the contract Deposit Billing Category Fee Allocation If Deposit billing category is a child category of another category, it will be removed from fees in the parent category, starting with the highest fee. If Deposit has a billing category that matches another fee on the contract, it will be removed from fees in that category, starting with the highest fee. Example: Deposit contract fee has a billing category of Tuition that is $1,000. Tuition contract fee has a billing category of Tuition that is $10,000. Summer care contract fee has a billing category of Tuition that is $2,400. Deposit will be taken from Tuition which is the larger amount. If neither of those, it will be removed from fees in order of billing category position. We have this behavior so that if an admin wants to change the deposit category to something else, it will update. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Deposit",

    "body": "Overview Most email clients do not support embedded video. However, using some of our best practices, you can still share a video with your prospective or current families through a Finalsite Enrollment email. -- How-To: Share a Video in an Email 1 - Upload the Video Online To get started, upload the video you are using to a video hosting website, such as YouTube or Vimeo. Learn how by following these links: Upload Videos in YouTube Studio (from YouTube Help) Uploading to Vimeo (from Vimeo Help Center) Once your video has finished uploading, copy the direct video link that is provided. This is the link you would share to send the video to a friend or post on social media. Please note that this is different from an embed code. 2 - Capture an Image from the Video Next, you will want to have an image to display in the email template. This is what your families will click on to view your video. You can use an existing photo, or take a screenshot from the video you are using. For instructions on taking a screenshot, see the following: Apple Computers Windows Computers We recommend pre-sizing your image to 600px (length) x 100px (height) to avoid having to adjust it later. The max height we suggest is 150px. 3 - Create/Edit the Email Template Next, in your Finalsite Enrollment site, navigate to Settings - Communication - Email Templates and click to 'Add a new Email Template'. If you have an existing email template you would like to add the video into, you can find it in the list and click on 'Edit' instead. From the toolbar, you can drop in the image you captured in Step 2 above or select an existing uploaded image. 4 - Link the Video to the Inserted Image After inserting your image into the email template, click on it to bring up the image options. Click on 'Insert Link' and then paste the direct video link you copied in Step 1 above into the URL box. You can also check 'Open in new tab' if you would like the video to open in a separate tab, instead of redirecting the parent/student. Click on 'Insert' to finish adding the link. Customize the rest of the email template as you like. Just remember to hit the Save button when you are finished. We recommend sending the email to yourself first so that you can test it out, before sending it to your inquiring, applying, or enrolling families. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Images and Video in Templates Email Template Management &amp; Best Practices File Management",

    "body": "Overview With the Scheduled Emails feature in Finalsite Enrollment, you can set up emails to send to a group or an individual contact on a specific date and time in the future. This article will cover how to view and manage the currently scheduled emails for your school. To learn more about how to send scheduled emails, click here . -- How-To: View &amp; Manage Scheduled Emails Within Settings - Communication - Scheduled Emails , you can view a log of emails that are scheduled to be sent at future dates and times. Please note : This page only includes scheduled emails sent from list pages and will not include emails scheduled through Automated Communication Plans . Email Information On this page, you will see the following columns for each scheduled email: Scheduled At - date and time at which the email will send Receiver Email - email address of the person who will receive the email Subject - subject line of the email Contact Emailed - name of the contact who will receive the email On Behalf Of - name of the student to whom the email is related If you scheduled an email to multiple recipients for a selected student contact (e.g. Primary Parents and Consultants), each will display as its own line on the Scheduled Emails page. -- Email Actions You can take the following actions on this page by using the buttons to the right of any scheduled email: Show - view the email that will be sent (in a read-only mode). Cancel - cancel the email before it is sent. It is also possible to cancel scheduled emails in bulk. To do this, first select the emails you would like to cancel by using the checkboxes along the left side. Then, click the green Edit button in the top right-hand corner - Cancel Scheduled Emails. This will prevent the emails from being sent and remove them from this page. By clicking on the blue Filter Options button towards the top of the list, you have the ability to search for particular emails by keywords in the subject, the recipient\u2019s email address, the name of the contact emailed, or the contact on whose behalf it was sent. After entering the desired information, click on Apply Filters to reload the page with those filters applied. Click on Clear Filters to return to the default view. -- A note on system date merge fields If you are using any of the date merge fields (e.g. \"Current Date Numerical\") in your Scheduled Emails, they will populate the date information for the day that you scheduled the email to send , not the day it actually sends out. Example: Let's say you went into Finalsite Enrollment on October 7th and scheduled an email to be sent to a family on October 10th. If you used one of the system date merge fields in the email body or subject, when the contact receives the email on October 10th, they will see the date pulled in as October 7th (when you set up the email to be sent). -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Sending Emails Sent Emails Page Email Best Practices Template Editor",

    "body": "Overview The template editor in Finalsite Enrollment can be used to customize the look and feel of your emails, letters, and even Parent Portal content pages. This article will show you how to use text formatting options, html code view, how to manage images and/or linked documents and more. In this article Format Text Image Management HTML Code View Merge Tokens Tags Permissions in Email Templates Format Text In the top section of the toolbar, you have various text formatting options available to you. Hovering your cursor over any of the icons will display a descriptor of what that option does. Any formatting option selected from this toolbar should be immediately visible in the preview. If you would like to clear any of your formatting options, use the eraser button on the right. The image below shows examples of what you can do with the text formatting options. Image Management To add an image to your template, click on the ' Insert Image' button on the toolbar. There are a few different options for adding the image: Upload from your computer - Drag and drop an image from your computer, or click to select the image from a folder on your computer. After inserting an image this way, the image will be uploaded to the Finalsite Enrollment File Manager to use in the future. By URL - If you already have the desired image hosted somewhere else on the web, you can input the URL here and click ' Insert ' to add it to the template. For best results, ensure it is directly linked to the image. Browse - Look for images that have previously been uploaded to your Finalsite Enrollment File Manager or are used on other templates. Move the cursor over the desired image and click the plus button to insert it into the template. Pre-formatting your images to a maximum size of 600px (width) is recommended for consistency across templates. The max height we suggest is 150px, though that varies based on the use case. Once you have inserted your image, you will see a few different options for formatting. For more information, click here . HTML Code View For more advanced editing options, click on ' Code View' on any template to edit the content in HTML. Any changes made in the code view editor will not be applied until you preview them out of the code view. Click on ' Preview Changes' at the bottom of the template or click on the ' Code View' icon again to preview your changes live. Click here for more detailed information on what you can do with HTML. Please note that HTML has limited support by most email clients so it is recommended to limit its use there. Merge Tokens Use Merge Fields (also known as tokens) in your templates to pull in dynamic information - such as student names or academic interests - from your Finalsite Enrollment system. To easily pull these merge fields into a template, use the Merge Field Picker above the toolbar. The first drop-down menu is the entity: Contact - The assigned contact (student). Recipient - The person receiving the communication; most often the parent. Note: The Recipient entity cannot be used in web templates. School - Includes school-specific information, such as Contact Information . System - Includes current date formats and Google Translate plugin. Please note, that while you will see Google Translate as an option in the System Merge token list in email templates, it doesn't work in emails. Google Translate will only work on parent portal content pages. However, as support for the web widget is being sunset by Google, it may not be the most efficient solution for your translation needs. Please see the note below. Insight: While Google Translate is still an option within your site and, if you are using this feature, it will remain in place, we do caution against its use, as Google has sunset its support for the free Google Translate for Websites widget, resulting concerns about long-term functionality. If you would like to know more about our alternative option, Weglot, please check out our Language Translation with Weglot article. The second drop-down menu is the specific field to pull into the template. Fields are listed by their display name. To find a desired field quickly, you can begin typing into the box. Once you have selected the desired field, click on 'Insert' to place it in the body of the email. Merge fields can also be typed or copied directly into the body of the template. All of them will take the form of: {{category.canonical_field_name}}. For example, if you wanted to pull the information in the field referral_method for the student, you could type in: {{contact.referral_method}}. Tags Tags can be added within the Template Editor to make it easier to sort and distinguish between groups of related communications. Template Tags can be added to custom email, letter, text, or label templates. Depending on which template page you are on (email, letter, etc), the experience will look slightly different. This is an example of the Tags field within a custom email template. Adding a Tag Within the template editor, in the ' Tags ' box, select or enter the name of the tag you'd like the add. Click ' Save ' when you are done creating or editing the template. To learn more about creating and editing tags, please refer to this article . Permissions in Email Templates Adding permissions in email templates allows you to control which admins can access/edit/view the email. To add a permission level within an email template, click into the permission set box within any email template editor and select which permission(s) to apply. You can add multiple permissions or leave it blank. If you leave it blank, the email will be visible/managed by all admin regardless of permissions set. If an email template has a permission set, only admins with that permission will be able to: View or edit the template under Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates. Send that template to a recipient. View the sent communication on the contact record, sent email page, and failed email page. Please Note: Admin Permissions are assigned under Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Admin Portal Accounts. Example: If you've set an email template with Medical permission (as seen below), only admins with Medical permissions assigned to them will be able to see and manage those emails. Did you know? Granular Permissions are also available for Checklist Items. To learn more about Granular Permissions, please refer to our Granular Permissions for Email and Checklists article.

    "body": "Overview Within Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates , you can access all of the email templates available to use in the system. Some of these templates will be custom (ones that your school or our internal team here have created), while others will be system standard (that send out relating to various actions in the system). Both types of email templates are customizable. Email Template Categories On the Email Templates setup page, you can navigate between the different categories using the tabs underneath the Email Templates header on the page. The available email template categories are as follows. Click any of the titles to learn more. Custom Emails : Custom-created email templates by all users. Any time you choose to add a new email template, it will be created under Custom Emails. Authentication Emails: Email templates related to Portal Accounts. Request Emails: Email templates relating to online teacher recommendations and document request forms . System Emails: Email templates relating to the inquiry, application, and contract forms. This includes the submitted form thank you emails, dual signature email, and internal notification emails. Billing Emails : Email templates related to the Billing process, such as account or payment notifications and the statement email. Please note: This category will only appear for schools using the Billing module. Options on the Email Templates pages: Add a new email template. Please note: You can only add new email templates to the Custom Emails category. Copy an email template. Use this option if you want to start a new template from an existing one, without overwriting the original. Please note: You can only copy email templates in the Custom Emails category. Edit an existing email template (this includes custom templates you created and email templates that are automatically sent out by the system). Use this if you want to update the email content, add your school's branding, etc. Delete an email template you're no longer using. This is an option for all custom emails and for certain system-wide emails across the remaining email tabs. Please note: This action cannot be undone. Revert to System Default - For system emails, this action will revert the template that was customized back to the default template. Please note: this action cannot be undone. Sorting by Last Edited Within the email templates pages, you can sort the templates to be displayed based on their edit date. You can do this by clicking on the Last Edited At column. Good to Know Once you select to sort the templates based on their last edit date, the only way to go back to viewing them alphabetically is to navigate away from the page and then back to it. When you return to the page after navigating away, the templates will be sorted alphabetically again. The easiest way to do this is to click on one of the other template tabs and then back to the one you were on. Filter Options You also have Filter Options which can be used within your Custom Emails tab. You can use the filter options to search for specific tags or filter the page by custom email template name. You can also filter by Blank to see any custom template that doesn\u2019t yet have a tag. Using Filter by Name allows you to search for templates based on their name. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Sending Emails Email Best Practices Template Editor",

    "body": "Overview When a payer makes a payment before they have a charge due, the ledger will adjust to the prepayment differently, depending on: If the payment is made before any current or future charges exist on the ledger The payment goes into the Prepaid billing category If the payment is made early and there is a future charge on the ledger that is not yet due The payment is reassigned into the categories matching the upcoming charges This article will cover those two scenarios in more detail and how the system will automatically adjust to them. Prepayments Without Any Future Charges (Prepaid Billing Category) When a payer does not have a current or future balance and they make a payment, the payment first goes into a Billing Category called ' Prepaid '. You can think of prepaid as a temporary holder for the payment while the system is calculating which categories to distribute the money into. The system automatically then makes that calculation and moves the money out from the Prepaid category and into whichever categories have a future balance on the account. For example, (as in the image below) if there is a ledger with no upcoming charges but a payment is made on that ledger, the payment will be held in the 'Prepaid' category until there is a charge applied to this ledger. Additional Notes: Schools can exclude certain categories from prepayments. For example: If a school wants all payments made before upcoming charges to only apply to Tuition, they can do so by going to Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories. Next , enable the option ' Exclude for Automatic Overpayment Logic ' for every category except Tuition. Important Note: Please do not deactivate the prepaid category on the Billing Categories page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories) . This will stop any prepayments from functioning properly. The prepaid billing category redistributes credits or payments to billing categories with positive charges every day . If a charge is added after the prepayment has been made on the same day, the redistribution will occur the very next day. Payments that exceed future charges, will also be applied to the prepaid category. For example: There is a ledger with the following outstanding charges: a $50 late fee charge and a $25 charge for tuition The parent currently owes a total of $75 but makes a payment of $100. The system distributes the payment to billing categories as follows: $50 is assigned to the Late Fee category $25 is assigned to the Tuition category $25 is assigned to the Prepaid category Next, the Admin adds an upcoming charge of $25 for a Library fee. The system sees the new charge and re-assigns the $25 Prepaid balance into the Library Fee billing category. Prepayments with Future Charges When a payer doesn't have a charge due right now but has charges due in the future and they make a payment early, the system will automatically redistribute the payment into the billing categories assigned to the upcoming charge. For Example : In March, the parent signs their contract, and their ledger populates with the tuition charges for the year. The parent's charges do not start until June 1st. The parent makes an early payment of $500 even though they do not owe a payment until June. The system sees a future charge due in June and the $500 prepayment is automatically applied toward the balance for June and is assigned to the category or categories assigned to that charge. Additional Notes: If there is more than one billing category associated with an upcoming charge, the system will distribute the payment amongst the categories based on the term they are owed in and then the order they are listed on the Billing Categories page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Categories). You can read more about this, within the How Payments are Applied section of this article . If the prepayment is larger than the next charge due, the system will look past it and distribute the payment within the next owed balance amounts in the ledger.

    "body": "Overview When setting and managing Admin Portal Accounts, there are several options to grant permissions to users. This article covers how these permissions work in more detail. Enabling each of these permissions gives access to different components of the system. To learn how to set up Admin Portal Accounts, click here . In this Article Notes about Permissions Granular Permissions Permission Types Permissions Explorer Notes about Permissions Student Contact Records Permissions do not hide access to student records in the system, but they do limit what data can be viewed within those records. Real World Example An admin without Enrollment permissions will not be able to see the Enrollment tab and list page, but through a search would be able to find students in enrollment statuses. However, within these records, enrollment-related field groupings and submitted/uploaded enrollment forms would be hidden. Search &amp; Reports Search &amp; Reports can still pull all contacts, regardless of permissions. However, certain field groupings and fields will be hidden to search on or add as columns based on the permissions set. Real World Example An admin without Enrollment permissions would not be able to search on any fields grouped under the Enrollment tab on a student record, nor would they be able to see these fields when selecting from the Change Display/Columns menu. Learn more about field groupings here . Granular Permissions Did you know? You can set granular permissions within Email Templates and Checklist Items. Adding these permissions allows you to control who can see/edit/view the item and the data related to the item. Check out the Granular Permissions for Emails and Checklists article to learn more! Permission Types Read a brief description of each permission level in the table below. You can also click on the article linked in the name column to visit the article dedicated to that permission. Permission Name Description Admissions The Admissions permission allows users to view and manage admissions-related data, including prospect lists, application materials, and admissions checklists. It also grants System Admin and Admins access to admissions-specific data under Settings. Enrollment The Enrollment permission grants access to student enrollment data and related functionalities, including enrollment lists and checklists. It also allows you to view enrollment-specific data within contact records. Admins/System Admins with this permission can manage enrollment settings. Note: Access to tuition and fees data requires Financial permissions. Scheduling The Scheduling permission grants access to the Scheduling tab, enabling users to manage calendars, create and edit appointment slots, and view/manage scheduled appointments. Admin and System Admin roles can also create new calendars. Communication Communication permissions enable users to send emails and text messages within Finalsite Enrollment. Disabling this permission prevents users from sending communications, though they may still access letter/label templates and (for admins) send password reset/authentication emails. Medical Medical permissions grant access to view medical-related data within contact records, including specific fields and related notes, activities, and emails. Enrollment permissions are also required to view this data on the contact record. Secure Secure permissions grant access to sensitive data within contact records, including fields designated as \"Secure\" and related notes, activities, and emails. This permission is crucial for controlling access to sensitive information like Social Security Numbers (where only the last four digits are displayed by default). Financial Financial permissions grant access to financial data and functionalities, including tuition and fee information, contract management, and (for Billing module users) billing-related features. Users can view financial data within contact records and (for Admins/System Admins) manage financial settings and access billing tools. Data Data permissions grant access to data-related settings and functionalities, including viewing ID field data within contact records. Admins and System Admins with this permission can manage fields, contact layouts, custom statuses, data imports/exports, and other data-related configurations. Reader Reader permissions allow users to participate in the application review process within the Review Module. Admins/System Admins have full access to all reviews, while Users and Limited Users can only access assigned reviews. This permission also automatically enables a daily review summary email notification (which can be disabled by the user). Impersonate Impersonate permission allows designated users (typically admins) to view the Parent Portal as a parent would. This feature is useful for troubleshooting and understanding the parent's perspective within Finalsite Enrollment. Permissions Explorer The Permissions Explorer is a downloadable resource that you can use in Google Sheets or Excel. It allows you to set an account level and permissions level to see what is visible in your site based on your selections. Please note: While this only allows you to explore one permission at a time, we included additional tabs at the bottom of the explorer to allow you the option to compare different selections. Click here to download the Permissions Explorer To use the Permissions Explorer, download the file and open it in either Google Sheets or Excel. (We find that the user experience of utilizing this tool in Google Sheets is a bit smoother). Interested in practicing before you download it? Use this interactive tutorial below (with audio) to get a feel for how the Permissions Explorer works. 7 STEPS 1. Click to open the account level dropdown under column A ( cell A2). 2. Select any Account Level for example System Admin. 3. Click to open the permission dropdown under column B ( cell B2). 4. Click select any Permission level for example, Scheduling. 5. Review what's visible to that combination of role and permission level in column C. 6. Use the other tabs at the bottom to compare combinations of account levels and permissions. 7.

Best Practices Only assign the social security number field to the \"Secure\" field grouping. Then, check everyone's permissions within Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Admin Portal Accounts so that only team members with the \"Secure\" permission checked off can view this information. We do not recommend marking the field as searchable within the fields page. If this field is chosen to be displayed within the contact record (set from the fields page or the contact layout page ), only the last 4 digits will display, and to view/edit the whole number, you must select to Edit it through a Show/Hide button.

To learn more about how to configure Admin Accounts and permissions in general, click here . Please note: For any Admins or Users who were assigned candidates to review, the list of candidates that were assigned to them will still be visible even if they lose reader and/or admissions access. Limited Users will lose the ability to view these candidates if reader access is removed. -- Reader Permissions The Reader permission option provides access to being assigned as a 'Reader' within the Review Module so that applicant candidates can be reviewed online in Finalsite Enrollment. Reader access can be given to any account type in the system, although different account types will have different visibility. Whenever you assign reader permissions to any individual (whether they are an Admin, User, Limited User, etc.) the ' Reviews assigned to me (Daily Summary) ' email is automatically enabled. Once a day, the reader will receive an email in the morning that lists all candidates that have been assigned to them for review. Readers have the ability to turn off this notification within their Username menu on the 'User Notifications' page. You can read more about user notifications here . Admins/System Admins Admins or System Admins always have access to the following, regardless of whether the Reader permission is enabled or not: Candidates in Review list page under the Admissions tab. Review tab on the contact record for all students in review. Read-access to review answers and scores from all readers. Users Users with the Reader permission enabled have access to: View any candidates they have been assigned to review or completed review for in the My Reviews list page under the Admissions tab. Review tab on the contact record of any student to whom they are assigned as a reader. Users with the Reader permission cannot see the Candidates in Review list page or anyone else's reviews of candidates except their own. Limited Users Limited Users with the Reader permission enabled only have access to the Review Module and only their own reviews, not the review results of any other readers.

    "body": "Overview Admin Portal Accounts can be created, edited, and managed by a System Admin only within Settings &gt; Portal &gt; Admin Portal Accounts in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Admins and User accounts do not have access to this page. You can see all existing Admin Accounts and their system access from the Admin Portal Accounts page. To learn what each permission provides access to in the Finalsite Enrollment system, click here . Please note the following regarding NEW Admin Portal Accounts: The new Admin/User you create will not receive an automatic email when their account is created. You can either let them know the password you set for them and they can change it upon login, or click the 'Reset Password' button on the right side after creating the account to send them a password reset email. See the section below on resetting passwords for admin accounts. How-To: Create or Edit an Admin Account To create a new admin account, click on the green plus sign and text for Add a new Admin towards the upper left of the page. To edit an existing admin account, first find the account by either locating it in the list or searching by clicking on Filter Options , typing in the name or email, then click Apply Filter . Once you find the desired account, click on the Edit option on the right side of the page. You will see the following Admin Details window open. Next, you can fill out the following fields: Email: Email address the admin/user will use to sign into Finalsite Enrollment (typically an official school email). First Name: First name for the admin account. Last Name: Last name for the admin account. Type: Account types define a specific level of access to manage system actions within your Finalsite Enrollment site, such as account management, system settings, deleting users, and module access. Each account type has a customizable list of viewing permissions, described below: System Admin: A System Admin is the only account type that can create and update accounts and permissions within your site. As a best practice, we recommend setting up no more than three accounts with this level of access. In addition, only a System Admin account can manage data retention for reviews and checklist items within the Terms settings page. Click here to learn more. Important to note: Only System Admins can access the Payments (Settings &gt; Financial&gt; Payments) and Disputes (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Disputes) pages. Admin: Pending any limitations set by permissions, an Admin account has access to all pages and fields of the system, including Settings pages. User: Pending any limitations set by permissions, a User account has access to all pages of the system except the Settings pages. User accounts also cannot delete contacts. For schools using the Online Review feature in Finalsite Enrollment, users have additional limitations. Click here to learn more. Limited User: This is a user type for Online Reviews. A limited user with the 'Reader' permission set can review candidates assigned to them in the Review Process. They cannot see anyone else's reviews of candidates and they do not have access to any other pages of Finalsite Enrollment. Password: (Upon initial setup only) Set a password for the admin account. Please note: Schools with Google Single Sign-On (SSO) enabled in Finalsite Enrollment will not be prompted to set a password at the time of admin portal account creation. Your Admins/Users will use the same password they have set in their Google account to log into your Finalsite Enrollment site. Password Confirmation: (Upon initial setup only) Retype the password for the admin account to confirm it Please note: Schools with Google Single Sign-On (SSO) enabled in Finalsite Enrollment will not be prompted to set a password at the time of admin portal account creation. Your Admins/Users will use the same password they have set in their Google account to log into your Finalsite Enrollment site. Permissions: Permissions control which fields and pages the admin/user can view throughout the system. Click here to learn more about what each permission provides access to in your Finalsite Enrollment site. If you hover over the \"i\" next to each permission type, you'll see hover text display within ~3 seconds, giving you a brief description of each one. Did you know? You can set granular permissions within Email Templates and Checklist Items. Adding these permissions allows you to control who can see/edit/view the item and the data related to the item. Check out the Granular Permissions for Emails and Checklists article to learn more! How-To: Remove Access for an Admin In certain situations it may be necessary to remove an admin's access to Finalsite Enrollment. Rather than simply deleting the account, the steps below will help remove an admin's access while ensuring no records of their actions within the system are lost: Set the admin account as a \"Limited User\". Uncheck each of the permissions checkboxes to ensure they do not have access to any parts of Finalsite Enrollment (Optional) You may wish to add a word like \"REMOVED\" in front of the admin's first name to flag that the admin no longer has access. This will just allow you to easily spot which admins have been removed while still allowing you the ability to track their history within your site. By taking these steps, you will ensure that the admin is no longer able to access the system, while preserving history of any actions they've taken within the portal. Note: These steps will need to be taken by a System Admin. How-To: Delete or Reset Password for an Admin Account Any System Admin can delete admin accounts from the Admin Portal Accounts page. Simply locate the account in the list and click on the Delete option on the right side of the page. You will be asked to confirm if you want to delete the account. Please note: As mentioned above, it is not advised to delete an Admin Account as a way of removing their access. Deleting an admin account will remove all reminders for that admin/user, as well as any reference to the user in audit logs. These cannot be restored. System Admins can also send any admin/user a password reset email by clicking on the Reset Password* option next to the admin account. You will be asked to confirm if you want to send the password reset email. This email will be sent directly to the admin/user, and contains a clickable link they can use to set a new password for their account. *Please note: Schools with Google Single Sign-On (SSO) enabled in Finalsite Enrollment will not have the Reset Password option on the Admin Portal Accounts page. Your Admins/Users will use the same password they have set in their Google account to log into your Finalsite Enrollment site. If they need to reset their password, this must be done in Google, not Finalsite Enrollment.

    "body": "Overview Merge fields, also known as tokens, can be used to pull dynamic information from contacts in the Finalsite Enrollment system into your templates. To learn more about the various uses for merge fields, click here . The following merge field categories can be used in Online Forms: Contact: Information that\u2019s related to or linked to the assigned contact (student). School: Information related to the school such as school name, school year, website, admissions contact information, etc. System: Information related to current date formats. Some common uses of merge fields on forms include: Displaying Contact Information: Merge fields can be used to display the contact information currently in the system for parents and students. A question can then be asked to determine if the parent or student wants to update that information. Displaying Student Information: If you would like to display a student's information, such as their name and grade/program, at the top of each form, you can do this by pulling in the information in merge fields. Contract/Deposit Due Date: If different students have different contact or deposit due dates, our team can help you set up custom fields to set for those students, which can then be pulled into an online form such as your contact. If you need help getting started on any of the above, contact the Support Team . -- How-To Merge fields can be added to your online forms by inserting a 'Comment' box field type to the form, and then typing or copying the merge field directly into the comment box. Example: Student information merge fields will always follow the format of {{contact. [Canonical Name of Field] }}, as in the example above. Learn about School type merge fields here and System type merge fields here . A Note on Testing Merge Fields on Forms It is always a best practice to double-check that your merge fields are pulling the correct information before setting a form live for families. Please be aware of the following with regards to testing forms: Although School and System type merge fields can be tested from the form preview mode, Contact category merge fields will not populate any information in a form preview, since there is no contact linked to it. To test any Contact merge fields on forms, you will need to first publish the form and test the form on a student record in your system. You can make the associated checklist item internal-only from your Checklist Settings , so that parents will not see it while you are testing. If a merge field is not populating data for a student, check that you have the right field name and that the student has a value set for that field on their contact record.

    "body": "Overview Merge fields, also known as tokens, can be used to pull dynamic information from contacts in Finalsite Enrollment into various parts of the system. To learn more about the various uses for merge fields, click here . In Finalsite Enrollment, information is stored for students or other contacts inside of fields . For example, you may have a yes/no field for International Student, or a multi-select field for Student Interests. The information or values that are stored in these fields can be pulled into your Finalsite Enrollment templates (e.g. emails), parent portal pages, and even forms so that you can display dynamic information about students in the system. How-To Merge fields can be added to a template through the Merge Field Picker or by typing/copying them directly into the body of the template. Learn more in our 'How to Pull in Dynamic Information' section here . To use a merge field that pulls data from a student record, you will first need to know either the display name or the canonical name of the field. If you have an Admin or System Admin account , you can easily find both from the 'Fields' page under 'Settings' - 'Fields &amp; Data'. On this page, the display name for any field is listed in the first column, while its canonical name is listed in the second column. With the display name, you can search and find the field in the Merge Field Picker. With the canonical name, you can type in your own merge field in the format of {{category. [Canonical Name of Field] }}. For example, the merge field for pulling information out of a field with the canonical name interests_academic would be: {{contact.interests_academic}}. Note: By default, any Boolean (yes/no) fields will output a value of 'true' or 'false'. To output a value of 'Yes' or 'No' instead, you can use a logic statement such as the following: {%if contact.is_international_student == 'true'%}Yes{%else%}No{%endif%} This means that if the field is_international_student is set to yes for a student, the system will output the word Yes. Otherwise, it will output the word No. For assistance with setting up logic statements such as this one, contact Support . Pronoun &amp; Gender-Based Merge Fields At times, you may need to pull in gender-based pronouns (e.g. he, she, or they) into your templates. This is useful in cases where you want to reference the student specifically, such as \"We look forward to seeing your daughter at her student interview this Thursday\". You can use any of the following in your templates: {{contact.he_she}} - Pulls in he, she, or they depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. {{contact.his_her}} - Pulls in his, her, or their depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. {{contact.him_her}} - Pulls in him, her, or them depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. {{contact.son_daughter}} - Pulls in son, daughter, or child depending on the gender/pronoun selected for the student. Note: By default, these will output in all lowercase (e.g. she ). However, if you want to capitalize the first letter (e.g. She ), you can use the capitalize filter. To do so, just place a vertical bar / pipe character ( | ) and the word capitalize after the field name but before the closing brackets. For example: {{contact.he_she | capitalize}} The capitalize filter can be used on other fields as well.

To learn more about the various uses for merge fields, click here . Schools using the Enrollment module in Finalsite Enrollment can utilize a special set of merge fields to pull information from the student Enrollment Contract into templates. Please note: Certain merge fields will only pull information after the contract has been submitted in the system. These are specified in the How-To section below. Information on merge fields specific to the Billing module in Finalsite Enrollment can be found here . How-To: Use Contract Merge Fields Merge fields can be added to a template through the Merge Field Picker or by typing/copying them directly into the body of the template. Learn more in our 'How to Pull in Dynamic Information' section here . Below are some of the key contract-related merge fields available to you: Base Tuition Displays the base tuition amount, formatted without the currency sign. The base tuition amount is the tuition without any required fees, discounts, scholarships, or aid. Merge Field: {{contact.tuition}} Example: 18500.00 To format it with the currency sign, use: {{contact.tuition|format_currency}} With that, the field will populate an amount that looks like this example: $18,500.00 Balance Due Displays the total tuition amount due with fees, formatted with the currency sign. Please note: This token captures the amount due at the time the contract is generated. If changes are made to the total tuition amount after generating the contract, it will need to be re-generated for this merge field to update accordingly. Merge Field: {{contact.balance_due}} Example: $6,600.00 Contract Amount Remaining Displays the total tuition amount due with fees, formatted without the currency sign. Please note: This information will only populate after the contract has been submitted. Merge Field: {{contact.contract_amount_remaining}} Example: 6600.00 Deposit Amount Paid Displays amount of the deposit that was paid. This information will only populate after the contract has been submitted with a deposit, OR the deposit checklist item is manually checked off. Formatted with decimal points but no currency sign. Merge Field: {{contact.deposit_amount_paid}} Example: 1000.00 Deposit Payment Method Merge Field: {{contact.deposit_payment_method}} Example: Credit Card Signer 1 Payment Plan / Signer 2 Payment Plan Displays the canonical name of the payment plan that was selected by each signer. If you are not using the dual signature feature on your contract, you can still use the Signer 1 token. This information will only populate after the contract has been submitted with a payment plan selected. Merge Field for Signer 1: {{contact.contract_signer1_payment_plan}} Merge Field for Signer 2: {{contact.contract_signer2_payment_plan}} Example: 2_payment_plan Net Tuition Displays the tuition amount including custom discounts/scholarships but does not include discounts applied through the financial_aid_amount and scholarship_amount fields. Please note: This token captures the tuition amount at the time the contract is generated. If changes are made to the tuition amount after generating the contract, it will need to be re-generated for this merge field to update accordingly. Merge Field: {{contact.net_tuition}} Example: $11,000.00 Net Tuition With Aid Displays the tuition amount after financial aid/ scholarships (including anything discounted from the financial_aid_amount and scholarship_amount fields.) Please note: This token captures the discounted tuition amount at the time the contract is generated. If changes are made to the tuition amount or financial aid/scholarship amounts after generating the contract, it will need to be re-generated for this merge field to update accordingly. Merge Field: {{contact.net_tuition_with_aid}} Example: $7,500.00 Contract Submit Date Displays the date the contract was submitted for the student's current enrollment year. Formatted as MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY, depending on localization settings. This information will only populate after the contract has been submitted.

    "body": "Overview Merge fields, also known as tokens, can be used to pull dynamic information from contacts in Finalsite Enrollment into various parts of the system. To learn more about the various uses for merge fields, click here . The merge fields described in this article are specifically for clients using the Finalsite Enrollment Billing module. For information about Contract Merge Fields that can be used with the Enrollment module, click here . Merge fields can be added to a template through the Merge Field Picker or by typing/copying them directly into the body of the template. Learn more in our 'How to Pull in Dynamic Information' section here . Below are some of the key billing-related merge fields available to you. Please Note Some of these merge fields use the Contact category, while others use the Recipient category. Merge tokens that begin with Statement will only work within the billing email templates, i.e. they will not work in custom email templates. Autopay Merge Tokens {{recipient.billing_autopay_enabled}} Displays a value of true (yes) or false (no) depending on whether autopay is enabled for the parent/guardian's billing account. You will need to use the Recipient category for this merge token since Autopay is set per billing account, not per student. {{statement.autopay_dates}}, {{recipient.autopay_billing_days}}, and {{contact.autopay_billing_days}} These all display the payer's Autopay dates. {statement.formatted_next_autopay_amount}} Displays the payer's next Autopay amount due. {{statement.next_autopay_date}} Displays the payer's next Autopay date. {{ statement.autopay_convenience_fee_disclaimer }} Displays a message that informs the recipient of the convenience fee associated with their charge: Note: There is an additional convenience fee associated with your enrolled autopay payment method of $X.XX. This amount will be added to the amount processed. Within the above statement, certain words are pulled from what you have set up on your Payment Setup page. The words \"convenience fee\" are based on what you have recorded as the Fee Description within the Payment Setup page. The amount that will be displayed within the message is based on the fees established on the Payment Setup page. The merge token automatically adjusts based on the recipient. For example, if they have a Credit Card set to autopay and receive an email with the merge token, they'll see the Fee description you have set for credit cards and the fee amount (either percentage, flat rate, or both) you have set up for credit cards. Additional notes: If the associated payment doesn't incur any convenience fee, that merge token will not display anything within the recipient's email. Because this token begins with \"statement\", it will only work within Billing email templates and it's only intended for use in emails that go out before a payment is made (like Upcoming Payment) and will not work the same in emails that occur after payment (like the Payment Received email.) We recommend including the token in the following Billing emails: Auto Payment Failure Retry Upcoming Auto Payment Upcoming Statement Upcoming Payment Upcoming Auto Payment {{ statement.formatted_autopay_convenience_fee_amount }} Displays the amount of the convenience fee associated with the recipient's charge. This displays only the amount of the convenience fee (no other text.) Example: If the charge is $275 and the Credit Card convenience fee is 3.05%, $8.38 would display. Important notes: If no convenience fee is applicable, $0.0 will be displayed. Because this token begins with \"statement\", it will only work within Billing email templates and it's only intended for use in emails that go out before a payment is made (like Upcoming Payment) and will not work the same in emails that occur after payment (like the Payment Received email.) Student Overdue Displays a value of true (yes) or false (no) depending on if the student (contact) is currently overdue. Merge Field: {{contact.billing_contact_overdue}} Example: true Account Overdue Displays a value of true (yes) or false (no) depending on whether the billing account is currently overdue. Merge Field: {{recipient.billing_overdue}} Example: true Account Overdue Date Displays the date on which the billing account is overdue. Formatted as MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY, depending on localization settings. Merge Field: {{recipient.billing_overdue_at}} Example: 05/01/2020 Billing Payment Method Displays the billing payment method on file (for autopay only). Merge Field: {{recipient.billing_payment_method}} Example: Credit Card Current Account Balance Displays the current remaining balance for the billing account . Formatted with decimal points but no currency sign. Merge Field: {{recipient.current_account_balance}} Example: 8100.00 Current Student Balance Displays the current remaining balance for the student (contact). Formatted with decimal points but no currency sign. Merge Field: {{contact.current_contact_balance}} Example: 8100.00 Next Account Balance Displays the next balance due for the billing account . Formatted with decimal points but no currency sign. Merge Field: {{recipient.next_account_balance}} Example: 8100.00 Next Student Balance Displays the next balance due for the student (contact) . Formatted with decimal points but no currency sign. Merge Field: {{contact.next_contact_balance}} Example: 8100.00 Next Account Billing Date Displays the next billing date for the billing account.

    "body": "Overview Once you have created a calendar , you can access various settings for that calendar by navigating to the Scheduling tab, selecting the desired calendar, then using the green Calendar Settings menu in the upper right to select Edit Settings. Within this menu, you'll have access to several configuration options for the selected calendar, such as adding an appointment form, editing appointment-related emails, selecting ICS file preferences, and calendar access options. In this article Email &amp; Scheduling Options iCalendar Calendar Access Calendar Settings Once you have selected Calendar Settings &gt; Edit Settings on your desired calendar, the Calendar Details window will pop up. This window contains basic information about the calendar, as well as several configuration options, as described below. Basic Information &amp; Setup In the top section of the Calendar Details window, you'll see some basic information about how your calendar is set up and will appear to families. Calendar Name: The display name for your calendar. This is the name that will appear when you're selecting a calendar to use on the checklist or a form. It is also what will populate when using the #{{calendar.title}} merge token in the selected calendar's appointment confirmation, reminder, and cancellation emails. Canonical Name: The internal name for your calendar in the system, used in searches and other back-end functions. This should be similar to your calendar name and can only contain characters 0-9, a-z, A-Z, or underscores for spaces. The canonical name is automatically generated when you create a new calendar and cannot be changed once set. Appointment Form: Optionally select a pre-created custom appointment form to collect additional information from families at the time of event registration, outside of the default information that is collected. Please note that your custom appointment form content will only be shown for students registering through the checklist or a public calendar link , not registering directly on a form (e.g. the inquiry). If you don't want to use a custom appointment form, leave this blank. Details: This is where you\u2019ll provide a description of the calendar event and any key information you want the registering family to know. These details are parent-facing and appear above the calendar. Please note that HTML and Liquid formatting cannot be used in the calendar details at this time. Email &amp; Scheduling Options Below the basic information in the Calendar Details window, you'll see the Email and Scheduling Options. This is where you can edit the content and configuration for the appointment confirmation, reminder, and cancellation emails, as well as set the booking window auto-close settings for the calendar. These are the communications that go out to parents. You can also set up a notification email to come to you when a booking is made within any of your calendars. Learn how to set that up in our User Notifications article. Email All Parents: For each appointment email type (i.e. confirmation, reminder, and cancellation), you have the option to check the box to email all parents. This means that the selected email will send to all parents related to the contact, instead of just to the contact/email associated with the appointment (which is the default setting). Enable Email Confirmation: Check this box to enable the confirmation email, which sends when a contact first registers for an appointment slot on the calendar. You can view and edit the content of this email by clicking on the 'Edit confirmation email template' link below this checkbox. Enable Appointment Reminder Email: Check this box to enable the reminder email, which sends a set number of days before the booked appointment on the calendar takes place (see next bullet point). You can view and edit the content of this email by clicking on the 'Edit appointment reminder email template' link below this checkbox. Send Reminder X Day(s) Before Appointment: You can use the drop-down menu to select how many days before a booked appointment the reminder email will send (if enabled). The minimum is one (1) and the maximum is fourteen (14). Please note: Receipt of the reminder email will depend upon when the appointment was booked . Enable Appointment Cancellation Email: Check this box to enable the cancellation email, which sends when a booked appointment on the calendar is canceled, either by the family or by an admin. You can view and edit the content of this email by clicking on the 'Edit cancellation email template' link below this checkbox. Good to know Learn more about Calendar emails in our Calendar &amp; Appointment Emails article . Enable Appointment Window Auto Close: Check this box to enable the appointment booking window to auto-close, based on the number of days selected (see next bullet point). When enabled, this setting applies only to parents and students. Admins will still be able to view and book appointments for any date. Close Booking Window for Appointment X Day(s) Before Appointment: You can use the drop-down menu to select how many days before an appointment slot the ability to book will close (if the appointment window auto-close option is enabled). This is a useful setting to avoid same-day event registrations and make sure that you have enough time to prepare for any students who are going to attend your events. Please note: Auto-close happens at 11:59 PM on the day selected. This means that if your auto-close is set to 1 day before, a student could still register for an event the evening before it happens. For this reason, we recommend setting your auto-close to two days before at a minimum. iCalendar Scrolling further down in the Calendar Details window, you'll see the iCalendar options. These settings allow you to optionally include ICS files on sent calendar emails to provide admins and/or parents with an easy way to add the appointment to their calendar. An ICS file is a calendar file that is saved in a universal calendar format and supported by most major calendar programs (e.g. Outlook, Google Calendar, Apple Calendar.) Include ICS Files on Calendar Emails Sent to Admins: Adds ICS files for calendar events on the notification emails sent to admins. Include ICS Files on Calendar Emails Sent to Parents: Adds ICS files for calendar events on the calendar emails sent to parents. Both of the above settings are enabled by default on your Finalsite Enrollment calendars. Below is an example of what a received calendar email with an ICS file attached looks like in Gmail. Please note that appearance may vary in other email clients. To learn more about the 'Sync with an outside calendar' option in the Calendar Settings menu, click here . Calendar Access In the last section in the Calendar Details window, you'll see the Calendar Access options. This is where you can specify whether families can book and/or cancel/reschedule appointments on the calendar from the Parent Portal, and whether the calendar will be available through a public link or not. Allow Parents to Book Appointments via the Checklist: Check this box to allow parents/students to book their appointments on the calendar using the checklist in the Parent Portal. Please note that the calendar must be linked to a checklist item for families to be able to book an appointment from the Parent Portal. Allow Parents to Cancel and Reschedule Booked Appointments: Check this box to allow parents/students to cancel or reschedule any booked appointments using the checklist in the Parent Portal. Please note that admins will not receive a notification for rescheduled appointments. Make Calendar Available Through Public Link: Check this box to make the calendar available through a public link, so that families can register for appointments on the calendar without submitting a form or logging into the Parent Portal. When enabled, you will see the public link appear, and you can copy/paste it to your website, social media, email, etc. as needed. When a student registers through a public calendar link, they are created in the system as an inquiry. To learn more about public calendar links, click here . Good to remember: Don't use public links for students that already have a checklist. So...why shouldn't I use public links for students who have a checklist? Public links create an inquiry form every time they are used to sign up for an event. If a student with an Admissions checklist fills out an event sign-up from a public link, it creates an inquiry for them and, therefore, can result in duplicate records and mixed-up statuses! And anyway, for all students who have already applied, you can just have them sign up for events through their checklist. Remember to click Submit to save any changes on the Calendar Details window!

    "body": "Overview With your Online Forms in Finalsite Enrollment, you have many different customization options. You can collect information from students and parents, you can add custom text with formatting, and you can even use headers to easily section out the information for families. This article will detail the different types of form sections and options available to you while creating new forms or editing existing ones. To learn about field dependencies and filter options within your forms, click here . Who has access to add and edit forms? Types: System Admin and Admins Permissions: Any How-To: Use Different Form Field Types There are several different types of sections you can use in a form. Each of these will be explained below. Click here for more information on how to edit a form and add fields. Click to jump to a specific form field type: Field Section / Subsection Header Comment Likert Definition Appointment Tuition &amp; Fees Payment Plans Totals Summary File Upload Field -- * Fields * Fields are the basic building blocks of a form. They allow families to input data that is written through to the system. A field is composed of the following elements: Internal Field Name: This is the name used on the back end of the system, also referred to as the canonical name. It cannot be changed at any point, even if the field display name changes. You can find the canonical name of any field on the 'Fields' page under 'Settings' - 'Fields &amp; Data' . Prompt: Text that appears for that field, visible to the person filling out the form. For example, a field called business_name might have a prompt of \u201cPlace of Employment.\u201d Map-To: This is the type of contact the field will be written to such as child, parents, or siblings. In most cases, fields will be mapped to the child (student), but parent and sibling information fields (e.g. names, phone numbers, etc.) should be mapped to the PARENT1-4 and SIBLING0-9 entities, as appropriate. IMPORTANT NOTES ON MAPPING FIELDS: Primary and Secondary Address Fields should only be mapped to 'HOUSEHOLD1' or 'HOUSEHOLD2' so that the households can be created correctly on the family contact records. Custom address fields can be mapped to other entities. Signature Fields should always be unmapped. If you need to collect more than one signature on a form (e.g. parent/guardian signature and student signature), you will want to have multiple signature fields created. No fields should be mapped to the 'RELATIVE' entities. To collect additional relative information outside of parents 1-4, you will want to have custom fields created. Finalsite Enrollment Support can help you with any questions or concerns you have with regards to mapping fields! There are also some additional checkbox options you can select for each field: Required: When checked, makes the field required to fill out for anyone that it is visible to. The form will not be able to be submitted unless all required fields are filled out. Required fields are indicated by red asterisks when filling out the form. Read-Only: When checked, makes the field unable to be edited. It will pull any data directly from the contact record for viewing only. This is used for displaying data, such as student name, that should be on the printable form, but should not be editable. Hidden: When checked, hides the field on the form so that it is not visible to the family filling it out. This can be used to set internal dependencies on the form. For example, a hidden field that can only be set by the school can be set to waive dual signatures on a contract form. Hidden fields must also be read-only. Show/Hide Field Based on Other Fields: When checked, gives you additional field dependency options to configure when the field will display or not display, based on other field selections. For example, you can have a set of questions that only appear when a student indicates that they are an international student. Filter Option List: When checked, gives you additional filter options to configure which options will display, based on other field selections. This option is only available on fields that have a list of values from which to choose (e.g. a drop-down list or checkboxes). Click here for an in-depth explanation of how to use Field Dependencies and Filter Options in your Online Forms. After you have added a field to a form and saved the page, when you return to that page you will see the Display Name and Field Type displayed for it. These are read-only on the page and designed for you to easily see this information at a glance. -- * Section Header &amp; Subsection Header * These two types of headers can be used on your forms to break out different sections of questions or content. The color of the text for these headers is defined by setting the dark accent color option within 'Settings' - 'Portal' - ' Parent Portal Design ' . Section Headers are the largest headers, typically used to break your page into its main sections (such as Student Information, Household Information, Academic Information, etc.). Subsection Headers are slightly smaller headers, typically used to further separate out questions within a Section grouping. For example, you could have Primary Contact Information and Secondary Contact Information as subsection headers below your Household Information section header. Here is an example of a Section Header (Household Information) and a Subsection Header (Primary Contact Information) on a form preview: -- * Comment * Comment type fields can be used for displaying any type of explanation or additional text anywhere in the form. Comments do support HTML formatting (e.g. change font color and/or size, add hyperlinks), and Merge Fields / Tokens can also be used to pull in dynamic information. This is also where you can place the Google Translate token if you want it on your form. Insight: While Google Translate is still an option within your site and, if you are using this feature, it will remain in place, we do caution against its use, as Google has sunset its support for the free Google Translate for Websites widget, resulting concerns about long-term functionality. If you would like to know more about our alternative option, Weglot, please check out our Language Translation with Weglot article. * Likert Definition * If you have any Likert Fields on your form, they must be directly preceded by a Likert Definition Field to define the rating scale. When adding a Likert Definition Field, you will simply type in the desired rating values, one per line. Likert Fields are most commonly used on teacher recommendation forms and some document request forms . -- * Appointment * Appointment type fields can be used to link to any of your Finalsite Enrollment calendars for booking appointments. This field type creates a drop-down list of every available appointment on that calendar, allowing a family to select their desired date and time directly on the form. Please note: You cannot add Appointment fields to the Contract Form. -- * Tuition &amp; Fees * The Tuition &amp; Fees field is a special field that can only be used on the Contract Form . When added to the contract, this field will automatically list out the tuition, any scholarships and/or financial aid, additional (required) fees, and optional fees for the student, based on the applicable contract fees and contract fee rules for that term. It will also total all of these amounts together at the bottom of the section. The 'Tuition &amp; Fees Total' text at the bottom can be customized by clicking the More Options button on the Tuition &amp; Fees field when editing the contract form. See the section below for more details. -- * Payment Plans * The Payment Plans field is a special field that can only be used on the Contract Form . When added to the contract, this field will automatically pull in the applicable payment plan options for the student, as configured on the payment plan setup page (within 'Settings' - 'Financial'). Parents will be able to click to choose which payment plan they want to enroll in for the school year. When a payment plan option is clicked, they will see the plan details, schedule, and any associated fees for selecting it. -- * Totals Summary * The Totals Summary field is a special field that can only be used on the Contract Form . When added to the contract, this field will automatically sum up the tuition and fees total for the student, as well as list out any payment plan fees, the deposit due, and the total amount due now (i.e. deposit + any fees added to deposit). It will also list the total that will be due after that amount is paid. Custom deposit, payment plan, and total text can be added by clicking the More Options button on the Totals Summary field when editing the contract form. See the section below for more details. -- * File Upload Field * File Upload Fields allow the person filling out the form to upload one or more files to flow into the student's contact record. File Upload Fields are commonly used on document request forms and teacher recommendation forms , but can also be used on custom admissions and enrollment forms. Since files have to be uploaded to an already completed contact, you cannot collect them on the application. When adding a File Upload Field to an online form, you can also designate a specific checklist item to be marked complete upon the file upload. This is optional and will only work with File Upload type checklist items. -- How-To: Use Special Section Options Some section types have additional options available. If applicable, there will be a blue button for More Options at the bottom of the section, which can be clicked to expand the options. All available options are explained in detail below. Please note: If you added a new field to the page, you must first save and return to that page before you will see the additional options. -- * Default Value * For Single Select (drop-down), Boolean (yes/no), and Phone Fields, a default value can be set. This value will automatically be pre-filled and displayed on the form, unless the family chooses a different option from the list. Click here to learn about field types. -- * Text Area * For Text Fields, the text entry area on the form can be expanded by checking the 'Textarea?' box in the additional options. This will make the text entry area on the form into a larger box, instead of a single line text entry. However, it is highly recommended to use the TextArea Field type, rather than using a TextField with the Textarea checkbox selected. -- * Hide Phone Types * For Phone Fields, the phone type subfield (i.e. the drop-down menu where cell, work, or home is selected) can be hidden by checking the 'Hide phone type' box in the additional options. When checked, the phone field will only display space for the phone number. You can use this in conjunction with the Default Value box in order to explicitly collect home, cell, or work phone numbers from parents, instead of primary or secondary phone numbers. Setting a default value ensures that the phone type is still coded on the back end of the system, even though a parent cannot select it. -- * Columns * For Booleanlist (multi-select) Fields, you can set how many columns the available selections will display in on the form by entering a number in the Columns box in the additional options. The maximum number of columns you can have is three. -- * Name Options * For Name Fields, you can hide certain parts of the name on the form by checking the appropriate boxes in the additional options. For example, if you do not want to collect name titles for students, you can check the 'Hide name title' option for the student name field. -- * Address Field Options * For Address Fields, you can hide certain parts of the address on the form by checking the appropriate boxes in the additional options. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Creating New Online Forms Editing Online Forms Form Types &amp; States Field Dependencies &amp; Filters on Forms",

    "body": "Overview Online Forms in Finalsite Enrollment help you tailor the experience for families by showing only the questions or sections they need to complete. This is done using custom logic, like field dependencies and filters, to hide or display specific content based on their answers. Both filters and dependencies are set up within the Advanced Form editor . Who has access to add and edit forms? Admin Account Types: System Admins and Admins Permissions: Any In this article Field Dependencies Filters Field Dependencies Field dependencies in a form let you show specific questions (or headers, comments, etc.) based on earlier answers. For example, if you only want certain questions to appear for specific grades, you can set up a dependency based on the grade field. This way, only families with students applying or enrolling in those grades will see those questions. Real World Example Agatha needs to find out if her international applicants require visa sponsorship. However, since this question doesn\u2019t apply to domestic applicants, she wants it to only appear for international applicants. Using a dependency is the perfect solution for this. Here's an example of what that looks like for families within her form. The basics Dependencies are added within the Advanced Form Editor. You can only add one filter per question. You can show/hide any type of section (e.g., fields, comments, headers, calendars, etc.). You can add more than one dependency to a question (or headers, comments, etc.). To make one question depend on another, you need to give the form the information it needs first. For example, if you want a question to show only for 3rd grade applicants, you must: Ask for the student\u2019s grade earlier in the form. Or, include the grade field somewhere in the form (you can choose to hide it so it\u2019s not visible to families.) This ensures the form knows the grade before showing the dependent question. Adding a dependency Within the advanced editor, you'll see an option that says Show/hide this field based on other fields? This is the option that allows you to set up a dependency. After checking the show/hide checkbox, some additional options will appear. Select an option from the Depend of Field dropdown In this dropdown, choose the field that will determine when the question (or header, comment, etc.) is shown. For example, if you only want the question to appear for 3rd graders, select the \"Grade\" field here. You can find the canonical name for any field from the Fields page under the Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data menu. You might find this article helpful if you need to locate a canonical name: How to Find Fields . Select the field that the dependency is Mapped to Here, you\u2019ll select what the dependent field should be mapped to, but it needs to match the mapping that it's been given wherever it's originally listed in the form. For example, if the \"Apply Grade\" field is mapped to \"CHILD\" on the form, and the dependency you are setting up depends on grade, the \"Mapped To\" value must also be set to \"CHILD.\" In Show For These Values, select the conditions that need to be met in order to show the field. The options you choose here decide when the field will appear. For example, if you are making the question dependent on grade and want it to show only for 3rd graders, select \"3rd grade\" here. This would mean that only families that select that they are applying for 3rd grade would see this question in their form. (You don't have to limit this to one selection. For example, you could choose multiple grades here.) Each section may be dependent on up to three fields. To add another field dependency, click on the Add a field dependency button below the show-for values in the section. Please note: When using multiple field dependencies, a field will only be visible if prior selections match all of the criteria. For example, if a field is dependent on apply grade being \u20187th\u2019 and on the international student field being \u2018Yes\u2019, the field will only show for students who have selected they are applying for 7th grade and are an international student. You can also remove a dependency by selecting the Remove this field dependency option. Filters Filters help control which options show up in a field based on earlier answers in the form. For example, if you only offer certain programs to certain grades, you can set up filter options within your form to show the right options to the right group of students. Real World Example The Mystery School offers Detective Fiction Workshop, Puzzle Writing &amp; Riddles, and The Art of the Red Herring programs to their 9th - 12th graders, so they don't want these program options to be available for potential applicants to other grade levels. In order to accomplish this, they can use Filter Options to segment specific options to show for specific grades on their application! Here's an example of what that looks like for families within their form. The Basics Filters are added within the advanced form editor. You can only filter fields (questions) in your form (not comments, sections, appointment fields, etc.) To make filter options based on another field's answers, you need to give the form the information it needs first. For example, if you want to filter program options based on grade, you must: Ask for the student\u2019s grade earlier in the form. Or, include the grade field somewhere in the form (you can choose to hide it so it\u2019s not visible to families.) This ensures the form knows the grade before showing the correct filtered options. If you don't set a filter for every option, the form might look odd because it could cause no options to display beside the question. In these cases, set up a dependency to hide the field for any grades that don\u2019t need it. For example, if you\u2019re using a filter to show certain options for specific grades, but some grades don\u2019t have any options set, those grades will still see the question but won\u2019t have anything to choose from. Adding a dependency is the best way to support this. In the example you see below, a grade dependency would be added to hide the Program options from those applying to kindergarten. Here's an example of what it might look like if you don't set options for some selections: Adding a Filter Within the advanced editor, you'll see an option that says Filter option list based on another field? This is the option that allows you to set up a filter. After checking the show/hide checkbox, some additional options will appear. Select an option in the Filter Options Based On dropdown In this dropdown, choose the canonical (internal) name of the field that you'd like to filter the options by. For example, if you want to show specific program options to specific grades, you'd want to select your grade field from this dropdown. You can find the canonical name for any field from the Fields page under the Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data menu. You might find this article helpful if you need to locate a canonical name: How to Find Fields . Select the field that the dependency is Mapped to Here, you\u2019ll select what the filter field should be mapped to, but it needs to match the mapping that it's been given wherever it's originally listed in the form. For example, if the \"Apply Grade\" field is mapped to \"CHILD\" on the form, and the filter you are setting up depends on the grade, the \"Mapped To\" value must also be set to \"CHILD.\" Filter your Field options Here, you\u2019ll decide which field options should appear for each choice in the filter. Each choice will be listed on its own line, and you can click the boxes next to it to pick which options will show. If you want all options to appear for a specific choice, you can click the Select All Options button on the right.

    "body": "Overview Checklist items are central to the Finalsite Enrollment system. Checklists drive flexible workflows that enable the collection of information, automated reminders or communications, and the ability to move prospective and current families through your process in a clear, timely manner. This article will explain the different types of checklist items available to you in Finalsite Enrollment. To learn more about Checklist Settings, such as parent explanations and additional criteria, click here . Please note: While our product can be used to collect any type of information via checklist uploads, we advise against use for the collection of medical information. If you need to collect or share medical information, please seek the guidance of healthcare professionals or legal counsel to ensure you are in compliance with governing regulations. How-To: Use Different Checklist Types Several different types of checklist items are available to use, each with its special properties and behaviors. You can use a combination of different types on your checklist to best support your processes. Read below for a description of each checklist type. Click to jump to a specific type: Basic File Upload / Multiple File Upload Calendar Custom Fee Online Form Recommendation Form Contact Profile Picture Document Request Form Special Checklist Items Basic Basic-type checklist items can be used to record basic tasks that a family or your internal team needs to complete as part of the admissions and/or enrollment process. For example, you could have an internal-only Basic checklist item for 'Welcome Letter Sent', so that your team can track when they have completed this step. Within the checklist item details, you can determine whether a Basic checklist item can be marked complete by only your internal team ('Admin' option) or by the parent as well ('Admin &amp; Parent' option). If the 'Admin &amp; Parent' option is selected, parents will see a blue 'Mark as Complete' button next to the checklist item in the Parent Portal. When that button is clicked, the checklist item will be marked complete on both the parent and admin sides. If you have a parent-facing Basic checklist item that can only be completed by your internal team, you should be sure to specify in the explanation how the checklist item can be marked as complete. For example, \"this item will be marked as complete upon receipt of your test scores\". Common use cases for Basic checklist items: Official test scores being received by the school. Downloading a student handbook or other document. Inquiry engagement plans such as inviting to events or follow-up actions. Internal process steps such as sending an information packet or performing a verification step. Please note: Basic checklist items will always show a completion date on your end (in the admin portal) whenever they are completed. In the parent portal, however, the completion date does not display. File Upload or Multiple File Upload File Upload and Multiple File Upload type checklist items are used to collect additional documents - such as PDFs, images, and other file types - by allowing them to be uploaded directly to the checklist. These files can be uploaded by the family from the Parent Portal, or by an admin from the student contact record. The maximum allowed file size is 1000MB. Additional Notes on File Upload vs Multiple File Upload All file types are accepted as long as they do not exceed the File Size Limit set on the Basic Setup page. File Upload checklist item is restricted to a single uploaded file, while Multiple File Upload allows for multiple files to be uploaded to the same checklist item. With both Single and Multiple File Uploads, uploading a single document will mark the checklist item as complete. Common use cases for File Upload and Multi-File Upload checklist items: Unofficial test scores. Upload audio or video work for art programs. Signed and scanned forms. IEPs or 504 Plans. File Visibility When you select an item type of either, File Upload or Multi-File Upload within a checklist item, you will have the additional opportunity to set the File visibility. The visibility settings will affect the experience on the parent end. Here is a breakdown of what to expect for File Upload and Multi-File Upload checklist items. Please note: Regardless of the visibility setting selected, you as the Admin always have access to any files added whether internally, or, on the parent end. Admin Admin &amp; Parent File Upload Only the admin can upload an item. Once an item is uploaded, it is not visible/accessible to the parent. Both the Admin and the parent can upload an item. Once an item is uploaded, it is visible/accessible to the parent. Multi-File Upload Only the admin can upload an item. Once an item is uploaded, it is not visible/accessible to the parent. Both the Admin and the parent can upload an item. Once an item is uploaded, it is visible/accessible to the parent. File Upload and Multi-File Upload Parent View Examples Before After Manage Files Once you upload an item to a Multiple File checklist item, you will see the Manage Files option. When you select Manage Files , you will see a pop-up with the option to: Upload additional files Edit the file name Delete the file Download the file Please note that parents will only see the Manage Files option on their end if you have set the visibility to Admin &amp; Parent. Calendar Calendar-type checklist items are linked to a calendar in Finalsite Enrollment and can be used to allow parents to book appointments in the Parent Portal or allow admins to book them from the student contact record. Calendar Checklist Item Completion Calendar checklist items should be manually marked as complete after the student or parent attends the event. Click here to learn more about how to link calendars to checklist items. Parent Access For families to see the Schedule Appointment option on the checklist item in the Parent Portal, you must have the \u2018Allow parents to book appointments via the checklist in the Parent Portal\u2019 option checked in the linked calendar's settings. Check out our Calendar Settings articles to learn more. Duplicate Appointments If a parent books a duplicate appointment for the same event, it you'll see both appointments listed in the checklist item on both your side as well as the parent's Linking Calendars to Checklist Items side. Learn more about this in our Linking Calendars to Checklist items article. Common use cases for Calendar checklist items: Student visits or evaluations. Parent or Student interviews. Event attendance. Custom Fee Custom Fee type checklist items are used in conjunction with Online Form type checklist items to allow you to collect additional fees on your forms. Custom fees can be driven by selections the parent makes on a form. When setting up a Custom Fee type checklist item, you must also select the appropriate Fee Grouping and Associated Form. Click here to learn more about Custom Fees. Common use cases for Custom Fee checklist items: Test registration fee. Sports registration fee. Book or t-shirt purchase fee. Online Form Online Form type checklist items are linked to a custom admissions form or custom enrollment form in Finalsite Enrollment. Click here to learn more about online forms. When configuring Online Form checklist items, you will need to choose an option for the 'Allow form to be completed by' setting. Available options are: Parent: Only the parent can fill out the form. All online forms default to this selection. The submitted form is viewable by parents and Admins. Admin: Only an admin at the school can fill out the form (internally from the student's contact record). If the checklist item is set to Required or Optional, parents will still see it on their student's checklist in the Parent Portal, but they will not have the option to complete the form. The submitted form is viewable by Admins only. Both: This allows both parents and admins at the school to fill out the form and see the submitted version. Common use cases for Online form checklist items: Student statement or essay. Emergency contact information form. Release or permission forms. Internal interview notes. Recommendation Form Recommendation Form type checklist items are linked to an online teacher recommendation form in Finalsite Enrollment. These forms can be sent to teachers or other recipients outside of the system. They also remain confidential to the school and have a unique workflow that allows both parents and admins to monitor the progress. Click here to learn more about Recommendation Forms. Common use cases for Recommendation form checklist items: Teacher recommendation forms. Pastor recommendation forms. Coach recommendation forms. Contact Profile Picture The Contact Profile Picture type checklist item allows parents or admins to upload a profile picture for a student. When an image is uploaded, it will automatically appear on the summary tab of the student's contact record. The upload workflow includes controls for cropping and rotating the image. Only one contact profile picture can be uploaded for each student. At this time, parent profile pictures are not supported. Document Request Form Document Request Form type checklist items are linked to a checklist item request form in Finalsite Enrollment. They are similar to recommendation forms but with a different welcome screen and more customizable email templates. Document Request Forms can be combined with other features like file upload on forms to enable the collection of transcripts, school records, or evaluation forms. Click here to learn more about Document Request Forms. Common use cases for document request form checklist items: Transcript or school record requests. Evaluation or interview forms. How-To: Use Special Checklist Types Some checklist items have special behaviors that drive workflows. There can only be one of these items active in any term: Application The Application checklist item is linked to your currently active Application Form in Finalsite Enrollment. It drives the application workflow and is unique in that it has a special link in the Parent Portal, can have application fees attached to it, and flows through the form import process . Application Fee The Application Fee checklist item is linked to the Application form and is completed when the applicable application fee for the student is paid online through the Parent Portal (for credit card or e-check) or is manually marked complete by the admin (for check payments or custom payment methods). Contract The Contract checklist item is linked to your currently active Contract Form in Finalsite Enrollment. It has a special workflow and supports tuition, fees, payment plans, and deposits. To learn more about contracts, click here . Deposit The Deposit checklist item is linked to the Contract form and is completed when the applicable deposit for the student is paid online through the Parent Portal (for credit card or e-check) or is manually marked complete by the admin (for check payments or custom payment methods). FACTS Integration The FACTS Integration checklist item is used in conjunction with FACTS, for schools that have set up and are using the FACTS integration with Finalsite Enrollment. This checklist item is automatically marked as complete once the parent has linked to their FACTS account and completed their agreements in the FACTS system. To learn more about the FACTS integration, please refer to our FACTS: Overview and Integration Options article.

    "body": "Overview Data must be in a certain format in order to be imported into the Finalsite Enrollment system. If you are repeatedly exporting data out of a third-party system for import into Finalsite Enrollment, you may want to consider setting up an Import Mapping Template. Import Mapping Templates (aka Import Configurations) are very simple .CSV files designed to minimize the repeated work of transforming standard files from any third-party system into a format recognizable by Finalsite Enrollment. These templates or configurations should be used for common, repeated imports. Examples include test score imports, inquiry imports, and any other import that will need to recur on a regular basis or where the headers from the third-party system will never differ. Click here to learn more about how to import data into Finalsite Enrollment. How-To: Create &amp; Configure Import Mapping Templates Create an Import Mapping Template Click here (or right click + save link as...) to download the sample mapping template in .CSV format. Only the first two columns of the file are processed by the import tool. The first column must be the name of the header in the first system. This must match exactly what is output as the header on the exported file. The second column must be the name of the field in Finalsite Enrollment to which this header corresponds, including the entity to whom the data will be imported. See the following image as an example. Configure an Import Mapping Template Once you have created and saved your import mapping template as a .CSV file, you are ready to set it up in the Finalsite Enrollment system so that you can use it on future imports. Go to Settings - Fields &amp; Data - Import Configurations. Click on the green Add a new import configuration button at the top of the page. Upload a .CSV configured file as described above and enter a name for the import configuration. Then, click on the blue Submit button. After you have done this, the mapping template will be available the next time you are run an import from Settings - Fields &amp; Data - Import Data . When you run an import with the mapping template selected, the importer will automatically configure the headers. Please note: Import files uploaded with a mapping template MUST have the first row be the file headers. There should not be a row above the first row. If you need help at any point while creating and/or setting up your import mapping template, contact Support .

    "body": "Overview This article will discuss some of the common assumptions and best practices of importing data into the Finalsite Enrollment system. Click here to learn how to use the Import Data Tool. -- How-To: Understand Import Standards &amp; Best Practices Each column header in a Finalsite Enrollment import file is composed of two parts: (1) an entity and (2) a field . The two parts are listed in the column headers with a period separating them; for example, CHILD.first_name or HOUSEHOLD1.external_id. Read the sections below for an explanation of both of these parts. Entities The following are the only valid entity types within Finalsite Enrollment: CHILD - The student who is being imported. All other records will be linked to this primary entity. Each row MUST have a child entity. PARENT1 - The primary parent in Household1. PARENT2 - The secondary parent in Household1 PARENT3 - The primary parent in Household2 PARENT4 - The secondary parent in Household2 HOUSEHOLD1 - The primary address at which the student resides HOUSEHOLD2 - The secondary address at which the student resides Important Note: PARENT1 and PARENT2 will always be listed as residing in HOUSEHOLD1. PARENT3 and PARENT4 will always be listed as residing in HOUSEHOLD2. These entities are often referred to as three subsets - CHILD, PARENT, and HOUSEHOLD - to indicate all entities sharing that designation. Fields Fields are the individual containers into which data is imported. Fields are always imported onto a specific entity. For example, when using a column header of CHILD.previous_school , we are importing data into the field previous_school for the child (student) entity. On an import file, always use the canonical name of any field. Canonical names are always lowercase and separated by underscores instead of spaces. To find the canonical name for a specific field, navigate to Settings - Fields and Data - Fields and locate the field in the list. The canonical name will be listed in the second column on the page. Alternatively, adding the field as a column on a search and then choosing the 'Export as import template' option export the correct header. HOUSEHOLD entities only have seven fields that can be imported into: external_id, address_1, address_2, city, state, zip, country. To successfully create a new CHILD or PARENT entity, the following three fields are required : external_id - The External ID should be a unique identifier, preferably an ID from another system (such as your SIS) that identifies this student or parent. It MUST be completely unique per contact - family-based IDs cannot be used. first_name - The first name of the contact. last_name - The last name of the contact. In order to create a PARENT entity, you will also need a CHILD entity to link them to, and you should also include a parent relationship (e.g. PARENT1.relationship) to define the relationship between the parent and student. For example, mother, father, or guardian. To create a HOUSEHOLD entity, only the external_id must be set, but the address fields (address_1, city, state, country, and zip) are vital to this field and as much of this data as possible should be filled in when creating an import file. When importing new data, the goal is often to create CHILD entities who are ' in workflow ' (i.e. in a status like inquiry, applicant, enrolled, etc.). To do this, the following three fields must be set on the CHILD: status: The name of the status of the student. This should always be lowercase and use underscores in place of spaces - for example, inquiry instead of Inquiry or parent_declined instead of Parent Declined. grade: The abbreviated name of the grade for the student. Abbreviated grade names can be located under Settings - General - Grades . A number directly representing the grade can be used as well (e.g. 1 will be read as 1st). workflow_year: The name of the term (school year) for which the student is in the status/grade. Terms must match the full name configured in your Finalsite Enrollment site under Settings - General - Terms. Any other field may be imported into the appropriate entity by finding the correct field under Settings - Fields &amp; Data - Fields and finding the 'canonical name' of the field. This name will always be lowercase and use underscores in place of spaces. To create the appropriate header, simply add a new column to the file with a header indicating the entity designation, a period, and the field name, e.g. CHILD.tshirt_size or PARENT1.marital_status. -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Using the Import Data Tool Import Templates: Creating New Contacts Import Templates: Updating Existing Contacts Data Import Mapping Templates",

Clicking the Pay Now button will take them back into the payment workflow and allow them to complete payment using any online payment method you have configured, such as credit card or electronic check. This is a great option if the parent is no longer able to complete the offline payment method they previously chose and would prefer to make the payment online. The screenshot below shows how this will appear to families within the Parent Portal. In addition to the Pay Now button, the checklist item will display your custom parent explanation text , the parent's previously chosen payment method, and the help text \"This item will complete upon receipt of payment, or click to pay online now.\" Important Notes: Parents are not required to use the \"Pay Now\" option. If they choose an offline payment method, you will still be able to manually complete the checklist item when it is received, and they will see it reflected on their checklist.

    "body": "Overview Within Finalsite Enrollment, you can use a Data Import to create brand-new contacts in your system. This article covers how to import, or \u201ccreate\u201d new contacts using our import templates. Please Note: Updating existing student/parent data through an import template is a separate process. Click here to learn how. How-To: Import New Contacts in Bulk The following steps outline the process of using our import templates to bulk-add students as well as their parents and households within your site. Download the appropriate import template Use the Create Template if you are importing in-workflow contacts, or use the Prospect Template if you are importing Prospects. In-Workflow : This term means anyone that has a status in the system from Inquiry all the way to Enrolled. These are the contacts who are ready to move through your funnel, as opposed to someone you\u2019d like to keep track of or that\u2019s connected to an in-workflow contact. (e.g. your Prospects, Parents, Former Students, Alumni). Those contacts are considered \u2018not in workflow\u2019 as they are not included in your funnel counts. Fill in the data for each column Click into each cell to either paste or type in the information for each student or prospect you are importing. Please note : The files have special columns within them that will automatically create ids for students, parents, and households. Once you start entering the name or household data, you will see the id created. Important Notes on the Process Boolean field values (yes/no fields) must be written as TRUE or FALSE in the import cell. Do not enter dollar signs ($) or negative signs (-) in front of financial values. Do not enter 'dummy data', such as giving all of the parents the same name or all students the same household address. The current term ( CHILD.workflow_year in your create template and CHILD.prospect_entry_year in your Prospect template) must match the format of the terms in your site under \u2018Settings\u2019 \u2192 \u2018General' \u2192 'Terms.\u2019 For example, if your terms are set up as 2023-2024, you should follow that exact format and not a variation such as 23-24. Grades must also match the exact format of the grades listed under the \u2018Abbreviation Column\u2019 of your Finalsite Enrollment site within \u2018Settings\u2019 \u2192 \u2018General\u2019 \u2192 \u2018Grades.\u2019 For example, if you have 8th grade listed in Finalsite Enrollment, your import must say 8th and not \u20188\u2019. Field values must match exactly what you have in the field in Finalsite Enrollment. For example, if you have a value called \u2018In-Person\u2019, the value you list in the file can not be any other variation of this (ex. 'in person') in order for the import to work. You can not import partial address data. For example, you can not enter just the City and State. You must either enter the entire address or leave it off of the import if it\u2019s incomplete. You can add additional fields within either of these templates in order to import data to any custom field. The correct format for these additional custom field headers will always be: ENTITY. field_canonical_name . For example, if the canonical name of your field (as found under 'Settings' \u2192 'Fields &amp; Data' \u2192 'Fields' ) is current_school, and you want to import that information for the student (aka the \u2018CHILD\u2019 entity in the system), your header would be CHILD.current_school. Click here for more details on adding headers to your imports. Both the \u2018 Create \u2019 and \u2018 Prospect \u2019 import templates can be used as-is ONLY if running the import without duplicate matching. When using duplicate matching, please remove any of the External ID columns (e.g. CHILD.external_id, HOUSEHOLD1.external_id) before running the import or it will fail. Click here to learn more about duplicate matching on imports. Required Fields for importing Prospects (you must fill in these columns) Student Name CHILD.first_name CHILD.last_name Student expected entry grade CHILD.prospect_entry_grade Student expected entry year CHILD.prospect_entry_year 1 form of contact (email/phone/address etc) CHILD.email Or, PARENT1.email Or, PARENT1.phone_1_number Required fields for importing new \u2018in-workflow\u2019 students (Inquiry \u2192 Enrolled)(you must fill in these columns) Student Name CHILD.first_name CHILD.last_name Student Grade CHILD.grade Student Term CHILD.workflow_year Student Status CHILD.status 1 Parent name PARENT1.first_name PARENT1.last_name 1 Parent relationship PARENT1.relationship 1 Parent form of contact (email/phone/etc) PARENT1.email Or, PARENT1.phone_1_number Full Address HOUSEHOLD1.address_1 HOUSEHOLD1.city HOUSEHOLD1.state HOUSEHOLD1.zip HOUSEHOLD1.country Save your file Very important: Before importing, save your file as a CSV file (Comma Separated Values &gt; .csv).Do not save with the CSV UTF-8 (Comma delimited) option in Excel or your import will fail. *Pro tip : Give your saved file an easily recognizable file name so it\u2019s easy to find for the import process. Import your file Navigate to \u2018 Settings\u2019 \u2192 \u2018 Fields &amp; Data \u2019 \u2192 \u2018 Import Data \u2019 Click on the \u2018 Import Data \u2019 link as shown below. This will open the \u2018 Validate and Import \u2019 dialogue box as shown below. Validate and Import Details Import Data : Clicking the \u2018 Choose File \u2019 button will open your computer\u2019s file manager which will allow you to select the file you wish to import. Import Mode : Select \u2018 Create .\u2019 Import Description : Enter a description to help you identify the reason for the import. Dry Run : Selecting this option allows you to test the import. Even if the import is successful, the system will not import any of the data if you have this option selected. There are a few options listed below that are not necessary to set when importing students. You can read more detail about what they mean here in the \u2018 Using the Import Data Tool \u2019 article. Use Mapping Template Run With Duplicate Matching Create Unmatched Parents and Households Click the \u2018Validate &amp; Import\u2019 button at the bottom of the dialogue box. If your import is successful, you will see ' Validation Succeeded ' in the Import Status column. If your import fails, you will see 'Validation Failed' in the Import Status column. If your import does fail, you can select the 'View' link in order to view the error messages. You will need to interpret the errors &gt; correct them within your file &gt; and then reattempt the import again. Below is an example of an error message on an import. This error is stating that the term used within the import file does not match the terms set within this Finalsite Enrollment site. In order to correct this, you would need to update the terms listed in the import file (under the CHILD.workflow_year or CHILD.prospect_entry_year columns, depending on your import template). In this example, we used a test site where the term was formatted to YYYY-YYYY as opposed to YY-YY. Therefore, the system is not recognizing the term in this example '22-23'. To correct this, we went back into this import file and changed the term to '2022-2023', which corrected the error. If you run into an error like this, simply go into 'Settings' &gt; 'General' &gt; 'Terms' to check how the term is formatted on your site and use that information to correct the format of the term within the import file before attempting to import again. Should you run into any error that you do not know how to correct, please reach out to our support team and we will be happy to help! -- Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Using the Import Data Tool Import Standards &amp; Best Practices Import Templates: Updating Existing Contacts Data Import Mapping Templates",

    "body": "Overview Within Finalsite Enrollment, you can use HTML formatting in templates (e.g. emails, parent portal pages, etc.), online forms, and even parent explanations on checklist items to customize the look and feel. This article will go over some of the basic HTML that you can use. Please note: There are some limitations with how HTML is rendered in different email clients, so highly formatted emails may not always be the right choice. Click here for more information. How-To: Use HTML Formatting HTML Usage in Finalsite Enrollment If you are using HTML in templates (e.g. emails or parent portal content), you will need to click on the &lt;&gt;&lt;/&gt; button in the toolbar of the Template Editor. This will open up the code view - click here for more information. If you are using HTML in online forms, you will need to place them in a Comment Field - click here for more information. HTML elements are defined by using tags, identifiable by the less-than and greater-thansigns. You will generally start with an opening tag - such as &lt;&gt; and end with a closing tag that is indicated by a forward slash / - such as &lt;/&gt; The text you want to output with the format will be enclosed within these opening and closing tags. Example: &lt;p&gt;This is an HTML paragraph. &lt;strong&gt;This text is bold.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; This is an HTML paragraph. This text is in bold. Below are some common HTML elements that you can use in Finalsite Enrollment. Bold Text &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Your Text Goes Here.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Italicized Text &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Your Text Goes Here.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Underlined Text &lt;p&gt;&lt;u&gt;Your Text Goes Here.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt; Colorful Text &lt;p style=\"color:MediumSeaGreen;\"&gt;This is text&lt;/p&gt; Line Break &lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;br&gt; tag to add a line break. &lt;/p&gt; Add additional lines between paragraphs by using additional tags. Each tag you enter creates another blank line. This does not have a closing tag. Inserting Images &lt;img src =\"example.jpg\"alt=\"EXAMPLE ALT TEXT\"&gt; This does not have a closing tag. You must use a direct link to the image in order for this to work. Typically, these will end in JPG or PNG. You can upload images to the File Manager in Finalsite Enrollment. Always pre-size your images to 600px before uploading them to Finalsite Enrollment to ensure correct visibility. Some email clients do not respect the image size HTML tag, so resizing the image first will help ensure consistency of its look across the different email clients receiving the email. Click here for more information. Hyperlinks &lt;a href=\" url \"&gt; Your link text goes here.&lt;/a&gt; If you want the link to pop out in a new tab, you can add target=\"_blank\" after the URL in the opening tag. Example: &lt;a href=\" url \" target=\"_blank\"&gt; Your link text goes here&lt;/a&gt; You must use a direct link in order for this to work. You can upload files to the File Manager in Finalsite Enrollment and link to them so that families can view or download them as needed. Combining Elements You can combine elements to get the desired look and feel.

    "body": "Overview In Finalsite Enrollment, students exist in specific Terms (or school years). Students can have a history and status in multiple terms. Occasionally, you may need to change the current term for a student in the system. This article will discuss the three main ways you can do this, and the difference between each method. Please note: Student Rollover is only available with the Enrollment module. Please note regarding copying over checklist items containing forms: If you opt to copy over the checklist completion, the checklist item will retain its status in the new term (checked or unchecked), but, the form itself will be found under the Form &amp; Document Submission History section rather than attached to the checklist item. If you want the form attached to the checklist, download it from the Form &amp; Document Submission history and re-upload it to the corresponding checklist item through the Upload button. Here are instructions on using the Upload button. Change Current Term: Copy to New Term Selecting the Copy option will maintain the student's data (e.g. checklist, history, term-based fields ) in the term they currently exist in, and copy them to another term as well. Example: Student A applied in 2020-2021 but did not complete the process. You want to maintain their history of applying in 2020-2021, but also move them to 2021-2022 so they can finish the process for your new admissions year. In this case, you would want to COPY the student. Students can be copied to a new term through a bulk action on the admissions list page or individually from their contact record. The behavior differs slightly depending on if you choose to copy in bulk vs. individually: Copying Students via Bulk Action Grade: All student grades will increment automatically based on the grade advancement rules set on the Grades setup page . Status: All students will be copied into the status selected in the 'New Status' menu on the Change Current Term window. If you need to move students into different statuses, move them one at a time or select in smaller groups based on the statuses. Checklist Items: Checklist answers (i.e. complete/incomplete status) are cleared by default in a bulk copy. However, if you want to copy the checklist answers over to the new term, you can check the Retain Checklist Answers box in the Change Current Term window. To copy over only specific checklist answers, you will need to copy students one at a time. For a how-to on changing the current term for students in bulk, click here . Copying Students Individually (from Contact Record) Grade: You can specify which grade the student will be in the new term by using the Grade drop-down menu in Step #2 on the Change Current Term window. Status: You can specify which status the student will be in the new term by using the Status drop-down menu in Step #2 on the Change Current Term window. Checklist Items: Checklist answers (i.e. complete/incomplete status) are selected by default to copy into the new term. To change which checklist items will be marked complete or not in the new term, use the checkboxes in Step #3 on the Change Current Term window. Good to know For a how-to on changing the current term for individual students, click here . Gap Year Note In some cases, a student will leave the school for a year and then return. In these cases, it's typical to copy the student over to the new term. When you do that, you may notice that the Contract checklist item is unchecked but still says \"Submitted\" under it. Something like this... This issue is not a cause for concern and does not affect the student in any way. When you are ready, simply generate the contract for the student and proceed like normal. Change Current Term: Move to New Term Selecting the Move option will delete the student's data (e.g. checklist, history, term-based fields ) from the term they currently exist in, and move it to another term entirely. Example: Student A applied for the 2020-2021 term, but then the family contacts your school and says they actually meant to apply for the 2021-2022 term. You want to move the student's data to 2021-2022 without having a record of them in the 2020-2021 workflow. In this case, you would want to MOVE the student. Students can be moved to a new term through a bulk action on the admissions list page or individually from their contact record. The behavior differs slightly depending on if you choose to move in bulk vs. individually: Moving Students via Bulk Action Grade: All student grades will remain the same in the new term as they were in the old term. Status: All students will be moved into the status selected in the 'New Status' menu on the Change Current Term window. If you need to move students into different statuses, move them one at a time or select in smaller groups based on the statuses. Checklist Items: Checklist answers (i.e. complete/incomplete status) will remain the same in the new term as they were in the old term. If you want to select specific checklist answers to move to the new term, you will need to move students one at a time. For a how-to on changing the current term for students in bulk, click here . Moving Students Individually (from Contact Record) Grade: You can specify which grade the student will be in the new term by using the Grade drop-down menu in Step #2 on the Change Current Term window. Status: You can specify which status the student will be in the new term by using the Status drop-down menu in Step #2 on the Change Current Term window. Checklist Items: Checklist answers (i.e. complete/incomplete status) are selected by default to move with the student into the new term. To change which checklist items will be marked complete or not in the new term, use the checkboxes in Step #3 on the Change Current Term window. For a how-to on changing the current term for individual students, click here . Student Rollover Rollover is only available in the Enrollment module. Rollover refers to the process of moving your Enrolled students from one term into Enrollment in Progress in the following term each school year. Students can only be rolled over from the Enrolled Students list page under the Enrollment tab. When students are rolled over, their history as an Enrolled student and values for any term-based fields from the past term is maintained. In addition, the following will take place: Grade: All student grades will increment automatically based on the grade advancement rules set on the Grades setup page . Enrollment Type: If a student's enrollment type was previously 'New', it will become 'Returning' after rollover. Checklist Items: Students will have a new checklist and a new contract will need to be generated for them to complete after the rollover.

    "body": "Overview Each calendar that you create under the Scheduling tab in Finalsite Enrollment will have its own associated confirmation, reminder, and cancellation emails that can be toggled on or off from the calendar settings . This article will discuss the different calendar email options and some specific behaviors around how they are sent out. How-To: Edit &amp; Use Calendar Emails Calendar Templates can be edited by navigating to the specific calendar from the Scheduling tab, and then clicking on Calendar Settings - Edit Settings towards the upper right. Please note: When you first create a calendar, the email templates cannot be edited. However, once you complete the action of creating the calendar, you can go back into the Calendar Settings to customize each email template. Within the Calendar Details window, you can enable or edit the three calendar email types. You also have the option to send these emails to all parents of the contact, instead of only the email address associated with the appointment (which is the default) - to do this, simply check the \"Email all parents\" box: Under the Email and Scheduling Options heading, you will see three different appointment email types: Appointment Confirmation, Appointment Reminder, and Appointment Cancellation. Read on below for a description of each type. Confirmation Email If enabled, the confirmation email is sent out immediately when an appointment is scheduled (either by the parent or an admin/user on your team). It will send out even if the appointment is booked for the same day, as long as the time slot has not yet finished. This means the confirmation email will send if the appointment is booked during an ongoing (reoccurring) time slot. It will not send if a student is added (by an admin) to an appointment date that has already passed. The confirmation email is enabled by default when creating a new calendar. Appointment reminder Email If enabled, the appointment reminder is sent out a specific number of days before the appointment is scheduled to take place. You can select between 1-14 day(s) using the drop-down menu provided: The reminder email is enabled by default when creating a new calendar. Please note: Receipt of the reminder email will depend upon when the appointment was booked. Reminder emails are sent out daily at 4 AM Central , based on the number of days set before the appointment. If an appointment is booked less than 24 hours before the reminder email is set to go out at 4 AM, the reminder email will not be sent. In other words, appointments that are booked after the reminder trigger is performed will not receive the reminder email. Example: Consider a case where you have an available appointment slot on Tuesday at 12:30 PM, and the appointment reminder email is set to go out 1 day before the appointment (i.e. on Monday around 4 AM). If the parent books themselves for that appointment slot at any point AFTER 4 AM on Monday, the reminder email will not be sent . Because of this behavior, a good practice is to put any key appointment information (e.g. video conferencing links, dates and times, meeting places, etc.) in both the appointment confirmation email and the appointment reminder email. Cancellation Email If enabled, the cancellation email is sent out immediately when an appointment is canceled (either by the parent or an admin/user on your team). Within the Calendar Access section of the Calendar Settings, you can choose whether you want parents to have the ability to cancel (or reschedule) their own appointments or not. Admins will receive notifications about canceled appointments, but not about rescheduled appointments. Best Practices for Calendar/Appointment Emails Customize each of the templates you enable with your images, branding, and personal messaging. Each calendar you create in Finalsite Enrollment has its own set of confirmation, reminder, and cancellation emails so you'll need to customize these templates for each of your events. Click here for more information on general email template best practices. If you are using user schedules on a calendar and have the video conferencing link and/or custom appointment text set for them, make sure you add the merge fields for them to your confirmation and/or reminder email templates: Video Conferencing Link: #{{appointment.video_conferencing_link}} Custom Appointment Text: #{{appointment.custom_schedule_text}} Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Creating New Calendars Calendar Settings Merge Fields in Calendar Invites",

    "body": "Overview For schools using the SAO Integration , Finalsite Enrollment offers an import template that can be used to import all Student Biographic Profile data into Finalsite Enrollment. The Integration currently brings over the following data: Student Name Grade Applying Year Applying Father Name, Home Phone, Work Phone, Cell Phone, and Email Mother Name, Home Phone, Work Phone, Cell Phone, and Email Primary Address Field Mapping can also be set up so the following data from SAO can flow into specific fields in Finalsite Enrollment: Country Of Birth Ethnicity Native Language Current School Enrollment Type Interest Residential Status Year of Proposed Entrance Country of Citizenship Visa Required Parent Martial Status Apply Status Apply Fin Aid Family Custody Student Email Address Current School (including school name nad address information) Interest Category Interest Activity Interest Future Involvement (all interest fields will be available from interests 1-5) Click here for a list of fields included on the SAO Import Template. How-To: Prepare &amp; Use the SAO Import Template The SAO import process involves taking the .CSV file provided by SAO and processing it for import into the Finalsite Enrollment system. The Self-Service Import Tool under the Fields &amp; Data menu option allows full update and create functionality. To prepare the template, follow these instructions: Export Student Biographic Profile Data from SAO. For instructions on where to download this data within SAO, click here . Copy all data from the Student Biographic Profile export (do not copy header row) Paste this data onto the first tab into the first blank row of the Template provided by Finalsite Enrollment, this tab is called \u201csource_file\u201d. Please note: Templates are unique per school. If you need a template to be set up for you, please contact our Support Team . Navigate to the \u201cImport\u201d tab and you should see the first three rows of data displayed. Because each of these cells contain a formula, we have only cascaded these formulas down three rows to keep the size of the file small. You will need to start with the first row containing data down to the third row containing data and all the way over to the final column OE and drag these formulas down until you see all students listed on the first tab displaying. After the formulas have been cascaded down and all data is displaying, save the \"Import\" tab as a .CSV by going to File \u2192 Save As, then under the \"File Format\" dropdown menu, make sure to select Comma Separated Values (.csv) as the file type. There are multiple (.csv) options in this dropdown, the first being CSV UTF-8 (Comma Delimited) (.csv), do not select this option. Navigate to your Import Data Page in Finalsite Enrollment under Settings \u2192 Fields and Data \u2192 Data Import . Import Options In the Validate an Import window within Finalsite Enrollment, you will want to select the options listed below. For detailed instructions on how to use the Import Data Tool in Finalsite Enrollment, click here . Import Data - Choose your completed import file from your computer. This must be in .CSV format . Import Mode - Select 'Create'. Import Description - We recommend typing SAO Import and the date range of applicants you are importing. For example, if you export students from SAO who applied between September 1, 2020, and September 7, 2020, use the description \u201cSAO Import 09-01 to 09-07\u201d. This will help you easily identify the last students imported. Dry Run - Leave unchecked. Mapping Template - Leave blank. Run with Duplicate Matching - Check this box. Create Unmatched Households - Check this box. Please note: Depending on how many students are on the import file, the import could take up to an hour to complete in Finalsite Enrollment. How-To: Re-Use the SAO Import Template On the Import Template, each cell on the \u201cImport\u201d tab contains a formula. For this reason, you never want to delete data from this tab. Instead, to prepare the template to be re-used for the next import, simply go to the source_edit tab and highlight all columns with data (excluding headers) and select from the menu Edit \u2192 Clear \u2192 Contents. Please note: If you have a different version of Excel, this may look different. Related Articles SAO Integration SSAT Test Score Integration",

    "body": "Overview The Duplicate Check &amp; Merge Tool lets you manually merge any two contacts in your Finalsite Enrollment system, even if they don\u2019t show up on the Duplicate Contact Matching page. Keep in mind: this tool only allows you to merge one pair of contacts at a time. If you need to merge several strong or herculean matches at once, you\u2019ll want to use the Duplicate Contact Matching page instead. This article explains how to use the Duplicate Check &amp; Merge Tool and provides tips for troubleshooting any issues that might come up during the process. To access this tool, navigate to Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data &gt; Duplicate Check and Merge in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Who can access this feature? Admin Account Types: System Admin &amp; Admin Permissions: Data In this article Merging with the Duplicate Check &amp; Merge Tool Troubleshooting Merging with the Duplicate Check &amp; Merge Tool Follow the steps below to merge duplicate contact records in Finalsite Enrollment. Note: Once records are merged, the process is permanent and cannot be undone. Step 1: Locate Contact IDs To merge two records, you must first identify each contact\u2019s unique Finalsite Enrollment ID. Open the contact record for the first duplicate. Locate the ID in the URL of the contact\u2019s page. The ID appears after contacts/ . Repeat this process for the second duplicate record. Step 2: Enter Contact IDs Navigate to the Duplicate Check &amp; Match page. In the First Record ID field, enter the ID of the contact that should take priority. This contact\u2019s data will override any conflicting fields. In the Second Record ID field, enter the ID of the duplicate contact. Step 3: Verify Records Click the Dupe Check button. A side-by-side comparison of key information, such as name, birth date, and contact details, will appear. Review the comparison carefully to confirm you are merging the correct records. Step 4: Complete the Merge Once verified, click the Merge button to finalize the process. Caution: Verify all details before proceeding. This action is irreversible. The duplicate records will be combined into a single record using the data from the First Record ID contact in cases of conflict. Match Strength Reference Use the chart below to interpret match scores: 0-124: Unknown (unlikely to be duplicates) 125-149: Weak match 150-224: Medium match 225-300: Strong match (likely duplicates) 301+: Herculean match (almost certain duplicates) Troubleshooting This guide addresses common issues when merging duplicate contacts and provides step-by-step solutions. If these steps do not resolve your issue, contact Support for further assistance. Merge Fails After Clicking \u201cMerge\u201d If the merge process fails, it may be due to one of the following reasons: Billing Accounts Contacts with associated Billing Accounts require additional checks and steps before merging. Action: Refer to the Billing: How-to Merge or Delete Contacts with Billing Accounts article for detailed instructions. Conflicting ID Fields If your system uses auto-generated ID fields (e.g., IDs from your SIS or integrations), duplicate contacts may have conflicting IDs. Action: Remove the ID from one of the records, then attempt the merge again. Switch Record Order Sometimes, reversing the order of the contact IDs resolves the issue. Action: Swap the First Record ID and Second Record ID and try merging again. \u201cCould Not Dupe Match Those Two Objects\u201d Error This error occurs when the system cannot locate one or both contact IDs entered into the tool. Resolution Steps Verify IDs: Ensure both contact IDs are correct. Check Formatting: Enter only the contact ID without additional characters. Examples: Correct: 81f56326-14f4-11e9-86f2-bc764e10a9f7 Incorrect: contacts/81f56326-14f4-11e9-86f2-bc764e10a9f7 81f56326-14f4-11e9-86f2-bc764e10a9f7/ http://yourschool. schooladminonline .com/contacts/81f56326-14f4-11e9-86f2-bc764e10a9f7 Ensure Existence: Confirm both contact records still exist in the system. Match Strength is \u201cUnknown\u201d or \u201cWeak\u201d The system calculates match strength based on weighted fields like name and birthdate. Even slight discrepancies in these fields can result in a lower match score. Resolution Steps Confirm Duplicates: Review the details to ensure the contacts are true duplicates, not separate individuals with similar information. Proceed with Merge: If confirmed as duplicates, you can merge them regardless of the match strength.

    "body": "Overview Students in the Admissions or Enrollment workflow can register for events from their checklist in the Parent Portal, as long as you enabled the 'Allow parents to book appointments' option in the associated calendar settings . However, there may be times when you want to register a student for an event internally. For example, you may have an inquiring family who calls you wanting to register for additional events, or you may need to schedule students for admissions interviews as an Admin Team. In these cases, you can schedule students for appointment slots on a calendar from the Admin checklist on a student's contact record. Read on to learn how! Schedule a Student for an Appointment as an Admin Before you can schedule a student for an appointment slot on a calendar, that calendar will need to be linked to a checklist item. The checklist item can be required, optional, or internal. For instructions on how to do this, click here . Once you have the calendar linked to a checklist item, you can schedule any student with that checklist item for an appointment slot by following these steps: 1. Navigate to the student's contact record in Finalsite Enrollment by using quick search or selecting them from a list page/report. 2. Locate the calendar checklist item on the student's checklist. Note: If the item is not appearing on the student's checklist, double-check any criteria and/or business rules you have configured in the checklist setup and make sure the student matches all of them. 3. Click on the 'Schedule Appointment' button below the name of the checklist item and you will be redirected to the calendar page. 4. Select an available appointment slot on the calendar and in the window that appears, click the 'Book [Student] Here' button. 5. Confirm the selected appointment date and contact information. You can also add an optional Internal Note for yourself / your team which can be viewed within the booked appointment details in the student's checklist, or pulled as a column into a registration report for event-wide planning. Please note: If your school is using a custom appointment form to collect additional information such as a total headcount of attendees, names of attendees, interests, etc. you may have additional fields that you can fill out. 6. Click the blue 'Submit' button to finish booking the appointment. When you book a student for an appointment from the admin side, they will still receive the associated calendar emails , such as the appointment confirmation and appointment reminder, as long as you have the option enabled in the calendar settings.

    "body": "Overview Learning how to get mission-appropriate families into your funnel is key to your enrollment goals. This article will teach you how to create a personalized and engaging journey for your Inquiries using automated and manual communications. Use the links below to jump to a specific section in the article. Parent Workflow - Inquiry Submission Parent Workflow - Communications Calendar &amp; Event Communications Admin Submitted Inquiry - Communications Admin Workflow - New Inquiry Notifications and Management Parent Workflow - Inquiry Submission Parents can 'submit' an inquiry a few different ways, which are listed below. Each avenue for Inquiry submission has its own unique set of automated communications that can be customized and branded, which are explained further down in this article. School Website Via a direct link to the Finalsite Enrollment Inquiry form on your website. Inquiry Form Best Practices: Make sure your inquiry form has both informational questions (are you interested in financial aid, what questions do you have about the school/curriculum, etc) and interest-based questions (what academics or athletics are most exciting) so you can utilize this information for your marketing and reports. Click here for our recommendations on building a great Inquiry Form. A best practice is to fill out an Inquiry form for a test student so you can get the parent experience and see all of the dependencies within the form (If I select \"x\" then I will be asked \"y\"). You can fill out a form by clicking on the quick action menu or ' + ' sign in the upper right and then select 'Fill out an Inquiry Form.' Public Event Calendar Link Via a public calendar link hosted on your website or included in an email, which links the parent/guardian to a Finalsite Enrollment hosted \"public\" calendar. Click here to learn more about public calendars. There's several automated calendar emails that go out and that should be customized as explained further down in this article. You can also create a custom appointment form for any of your events if you'd like to collect customized information that isn't included in our standard appointment form. Once a parent fills out the inquiry form or signs up for an event through a public calendar link, they'll receive some automated communications that can be personalized to the family. The next section explores these touch points for each inquiry 'submission' type in more detail. ---- Parent Workflow - Communications Inquiry Form Submission - Automated Communications There's a few automated communications that go out by default during the Inquiry Process, so please make sure you review each template, and personalize/brand each of them. Please also refer to the article on email best practices . Event Registration: If you have event registration on your Inquiry form, a parent will receive an automated confirmation email as long as the confirmation email is enabled under your calendar settings, upon submission of the Inquiry form for each event registration. In addition, they may receive a reminder email if one is set within the calendar settings. Form Submission: Upon form submission, the parent/guardian will see the ' Inquiry Thank You ' landing page . This is located within Settings--Portal--Parent Portal Content--Inquiry Thank You. Click here for content recommendations and best practices. Form Submission: Upon form submission, the parent/guardian will also receive an automated 'Inquiry Thank You' email, if this is enabled under Communication Setup . The email template is located within Settings--Communications--Email Templates--System Emails. Click here to learn more. Make sure you customize this email with images, warm and friendly messaging, and anything that's 'you'nique to your brand. Automated Communications (Finalsite Enrollment PRO): For schools using our PRO plan, you can utilize our Automated Communication Plans feature to setup different triggers for an engagement cadence. This is useful for sending personalized emails for financial aid families, interest based communications, boarding vs day communications, event attendance thank you emails, etc. These are located within Settings--Communication--Automated Communication Plans--Inquiry tab. Next, click here for Inquiry Process examples and setup instructions. Reach out to our Support team if you'd like assistance in setting up the rules and criteria. Inquiry Form Submission - Additional Communications (Automated and Manual) Create a communication plan/map. Define who your target audience is, who each message is coming from, and what criteria is needed for the communication to be sent. If you're a team of one or of many, it's important that everyone is included in the process. Once you have your communication plan created, you'll want to create customized email templates for each within Settings--Communications--Email Templates--Custom Emails. Click here for email best practices. A list of Inquiry email examples is included in our admissions automated communications article . Please note, these emails can also be sent manually and in bulk to families using filter options within the Admissions tab--Inquiries or within a custom search that's built with any criteria you need. You can also send emails to individual contacts through the Inquiry Record, using the Communicate menu . Calendar and Event Communications Inquiry Submission via a Public Calendar - Automated Communications When families sign up for an event through a public calendar link , they'll pick a time-slot and fill out the appointment form. Please note, we provide a standard appointment form for all calendars by default, but if you'd like to ask for additional information, you can build a custom appointment form . If you need help, please work with our Support team . IMPORTANT: Event registration through a public calendar will not display the Inquiry Landing Page, nor will it send the Inquiry Thank You email. These two communications are specific to an Inquiry Form that's submitted by a parent only . (Admin's can fill out Inquiry forms on behalf of families, but both of these communications will not be shown or sent to the Admin or to the parent). Calendar Emails Each event has up to 3 automated email templates you can customize and send, which are located within the Calendar Settings of the event you're managing. First you'll click on the Scheduling tab--Calendars--Select the calendar name--Calendar Settings button in the upper right--Edit Settings. You can learn more about each template listed below within the hyperlinked article above. Each template can be toggled on or off and personalized with your brand. Confirmation Email - sent automatically upon registration submission. Reminder Email - sent \"x\" number of days prior to the event at 4am Central. Exception: If an appointment is booked less than 24 hours before the reminder email is set to go out at 4 AM, the reminder email will not be sent, but the confirmation email will be sent. Cancellation Email - sent upon cancellation of a registered parent/guardian for an event. Virtual Events If you'd like to provide custom web links for virtual events, click here to learn more. -- Admin Submitted Inquiry - Communications If you or another team member submits an Inquiry form via the quick action menu , noted by the + sign in the upper right by your username, the Inquiry Thank You page will not display and the automated Inquiry Thank you email will not be sent to the parent/guardian. If you register the parent for any events on the Inquiry form, or from the checklist once the records are created, the parent will receive all automated calendar emails that are turned on for that event. If you have any automated communication plans setup, these will also be triggered once you submit the Inquiry form. If you'd like to send an 'Inquiry Thank You' follow-up email to send the parent/guardian some follow-up information, you can send one manually via the contact record of the Inquiry. Admin Workflow - New Inquiry Notifications and Management The timing of your follow-up to a new Inquiry is critical to the nurturing process. To ensure you don't miss any new inquiries, you can set automated email notifications. Within your username menu in the upper right of your set, select ' User Notifications. ' Within this page, you can turn on the 'Inquiry received from parent' email which can also be customized to include additional fields. You can also turn on email notifications for each event registration within the 'Immediate Calendar Notifications' section.

    "body": "Overview Did you know? Did you know that you can create and edit your own fields? Check out this article to learn more: Creating and Editing Fields. Within Finalsite Enrollment, fields are the containers that store specific data about students, parents, or other contacts in the system. To learn more about what fields are and how they work, click here . This article will detail the different types of fields that exist in Finalsite Enrollment and the specific type of information that each one can hold. Field Types Reference Table Below is a list of the different field types and a brief description of each. Field Type Description AddressField (composite field) Holds all parts of an address. International addresses are supported. The standard address field will be mapped to Household1 or Household2, but additional custom address fields can be created to collect information such as school addresses, recommender addresses, etc. Contains subfields: address_1, address_2, address_city, address_state, address_zip, and address_country. BooleanField Field in which accepted values are only yes (true) or no (false) . Additional options cannot be added to Boolean Fields. BooleanlistField Multi-select field in which one or more of the listed options can be selected. Useful for collecting data such as academic or athletic interests, so that a student can check all that apply. CurrencyField Holds currency amounts, formatted with a decimal point and no commas. If displaying a CurrencyField amount in Liquid , a filter can be used to format it with a dollar sign and commas. DateField Holds dates. Validation requires correct formatting with month, day, and year - all other formats will be rejected. Date display (e.g. MM/DD/YYYY or DD/MM/YYYY) depends on the Locale setting selected within 'Settings' - 'General' - 'Basic Setup' . EmailField Holds emails. Validation requires correct formatting as _____ @ _____ . _____ - all other formats will be rejected. IdField Holds a unique ID or value for each contact in the system. Conflicting values (i.e. those already assigned to another contact) will be rejected. LikertField Likert scale checkboxes often used on recommendation forms . Please note: Data collected in LikertFields on forms does not write through to the system. Must be preceded on forms by a LikertDefinitionField to determine rating options. NameField (composite field) Holds all parts of a name. The standard name field will be mapped to specific entities such as the child (student), parent1-4, sibling0-9, etc., but additional custom name fields can be created to collect information such as grandparent names, teacher names, etc. Subfields are name_title, first_name, middle_name, last_name, name_suffix, and preferred_name. NumberField Holds numbers, formatted with a decimal point and no commas. PhoneField (composite field) Holds phone numbers. International phone numbers and extensions are supported. There are three standard phone fields (phone_1, phone_2, and phone_3), but additional custom phone fields can be created to collect information such as school phone numbers, emergency contact phone numbers, etc. Subfields are type (valid values = home, cell, work) and number. ScholarshipField Special field where the amount entered into it is automatically subtracted from the tuition amount on a student's contract. Click here for more information. SignatureField Electronic signature tied to IP address. AdditionalSignatureField Second electronic signature tied to IP address, which prompts an additional signer to be invited. Used for dual signature contracts and only available on the Contract, not any additional forms. SingleSelectField Drop-down list field in which only one selection can be made from the list of options. Useful for collecting data such as t-shirt size, so that a single value can be selected from a list of options. TextField Smaller open text box that can hold any type of information. Text Fields do not have set character or word limits. TextAreaField Larger open text box that can hold any type of information. It preserves line breaks and will always display submitted data across the full width of the page to make it easier to read long answers. Ideal for essays, internal notes, and any other items requiring longer responses. TextArea Fields do not have set character or word limits. Additional Field Types Please note: You may see some additional field types -- such as ApplyGradeField or ApplyYearField -- on the Fields setup page or elsewhere. However, these are special fields with unique behaviors and we cannot create new fields with these types. We can only create new fields using the types in the table listed above.

    "body": "Schools can embed their inquiry form into any webpage that supports iframe embedding such as Finalsite CMS composer and other website content managers. Quick Guide Step 1: Get the embed link Go to the inquiry form setup page and click on the Select dropdown on the Active version of your inquiry form. In the dropdown, select Embed : The modal will provide the embed link and the ability to copy that link to your clipboard: Step 2: Add to your website Each website has a different embed mechanism but most have the ability to add code or has an 'embed' feature for iframe code. Copy the iframe code that displays in your Embed Inquiry pop-up into your website. Good to know: pasting the URL instead of the iframe code Many popular CMS platforms allow you the option to simply paste the URL into an embed space. If you have this option within your CMS, just copy the link that is within the \"src\" area of the code, as illustrated in the example GIF below. Step 3. Customize size Depending on the page design, you may want to change the width and heights of the form portion. To do this change the width= value to the appropriate size. We recommend that the minimum width is around 560 which is about the width of an average mobile device. The appropriate height depends on the number of fields on the form. You can adjust this until it fits your page's design. Step 4. Customize look and feel By default, the iframe imports the default style guide to ensure the form renders properly. The form does not include the header, the footer, and backgrounds from the normal inquiry page. You can override those styles by adding custom CSS at the bottom of the webpage. The mechanism will depend on your CMS provider. Post submit action / Thank you page When a form is submitted, the Thank you page content will be displayed.

    "body": "Overview This article contains an overview of Payments, including info about what it is, key details and benefits of its use, and answers to frequently asked questions. If you are looking for in-depth steps of the onboarding and setup process, please refer to this article. In this article What is Payments? Benefits of using Payments Country/Currency Convenience Fees Passing Fees on to Parents Link Frequently Asked Questions Getting Started Support Verification Account Ownership Payment Workflows What is Payments? Please note that only those designated as System Admins within your site will have access to set up and manage your Payments account. Payments is a simple and powerful way to accept funds inside the Finalsite Enrollment application. It is powered by Stripe and is natively built into the existing Finalsite Enrollment platform experience so that you and your applying or enrolling families can take care of everything within one centralized site. Payments meets and exceeds the most stringent industry standards for security. Stripe is also audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the highest level of certification available. You can learn more about the technical details of Stripe\u2019s secure infrastructure here and see Stripe\u2019s PCI certification here . Click here to learn more about setting up your Payments account, including onboarding, identity verification, and adding your banking information. Benefits of Payments All payment and payout information is accessible directly within Finalsite Enrollment. Easily initiate refunds directly within Finalsite Enrollment. Improved and automated ACH verification process for families that no longer includes micro-deposits for most banks . They can either enter their bank account details manually, or they can choose their bank from a set list through an SSO process. Allows families to save and manage multiple payment profiles in their Finalsite Enrollment account. Country/Currency Every school is designated a single currency and, based on your currency/country, the correct currency symbols will be displayed in front of transactions. Please note that countries utilizing the Euro do have certain limitations. Read below to learn more. U.S. and Canada Schools in the U.S. and Canada that are set up with Payments can accept credit card and ACH/PAD payments through their payments account. Euro, British Pound Sterling, and Thai Bhat Schools in some areas of the U.K., Europe*, and Thailand that are set up with Payments can accept credit card payments through their payments account. Important Notes Payment processing in these countries is only available for Application, Deposit, and AdHoc fee processing. Only credit card payments can be accepted. *The following countries can process online credit card payments using the Euro in Finalsite Enrollment: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Convenience Fees A convenience fee is a charge applied to online payment methods, such as credit card and electronic check payments to cover the cost of processing. Where can I see the rates for my school? In Finalsite Enrollment, you can see the rates for your school on the Payments page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments). On this page, you will see a Payment Fees section. This section displays your rate information. It can not be edited. You can also see your school's rates on the Payment Setup page in the Credit Card and Electronic Check sections of that page. You'll see a note that looks something like this, with your specific rates visible. Passing Fees on to Parents Schools may choose to pass their convenience fees for credit card or electronic check payments to the parent. Convenience fees can be applied to the deposit, application, ad-hoc forms, or billing. They can be in the form of: a flat dollar amount a percentage or a combination of both A fee description, as well as a fee notification message, can also be configured to show on payment screens. Convenience fee types (percentage, flat fee, or combination) and descriptions/notifications can be configured separately for credit cards and electronic checks. Fees passed on to parents can be adjusted under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payment Setup. Please note that only those designated as System Admin or Admin have access to this page. Read more about the process in our article: Payments: Passing on Convenience Fees to Parents Alerts If your Payments account is in need of attention, the following alerts are designed to notify you and provide direction on what action is needed: A red banner will appear at the top of your site letting you know an update to your Payments account is needed. The banner will only be visible to System Admins and will look something like this (the text you see may be slightly different). An email will be sent to the account owner. The email will provide the details of the issue and directions on how to correct it. The Payments page will also display a note with the details of the issue and directions on how to correct it. Please note: Only the Account owner will be able to make the update. Only account owners have access to \"Update Information\" on the payments page due to 2 factor authentication. The error message on the Payments page and within the email lists the issue two times. This is the way the message comes over from Stripe and not something that can not be altered on our end. Link During the payment process, parents can choose to use Link (powered by Stripe) to securely save their payment information. This will make their future payments easier by auto-filling their payment details. Once signed up, parents can also use Link to autofill their Credit Card info on any other website that supports Link. What you need to know about Link: Link is created by Stripe (the tool that powers our Payment processing.) Link is automatically enabled for all Stripe Payments schools. (It doesn't cost anything and doesn't need to be set up on your end. It's already there as an option for parents.) Using Link does not affect or interfere with Autopay setup. Link is secure. Here's an excerpt from Stripe's website regarding security: Since Link is powered by Stripe, a global payments provider, we are certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1 . This is the highest level of certification available in the payments industry. For more insight and a peek into what the process looks like when connecting to Link, please refer to this article: Payments: Link Frequently Asked Questions In the section below, you will find answers to frequently asked questions about Payments. Use the links below to quickly jump to a specific subsection: Getting Started Support Verification Account Ownership Payment Workflows Resources You can review the Stripe Connected Account agreement at any time by clicking here. You can review Stripe's 2024 Updates to US Verification Requirements here. Getting Started Is Payments secure? Will I be PCI-compliant? Yes! Payments meets and exceeds the most stringent industry standards for security. Stripe is also audited by a PCI-certified auditor and is certified to PCI Service Provider Level 1. This is the highest level of certification available. You can learn more about the technical details of Stripe\u2019s secure infrastructure here and see Stripe\u2019s PCI certification here . What information do I need to sign up for Payments? To sign up for an account, you will need to gather the following information: Your type of business and business structure. Information related to your school, such as your EIN, address, and website. Contact information for the individual at your school responsible for managing Payments. This will likely include their name, email, date of birth, address, phone and the last four digits of their Social Security number OR an official ID document. Common follow-up requirements include photo identification documents and address verification. Read more about the requirements and what's needed for each step here. Please note that only those designated as System Admin have access to the onboarding page. What if I already have a Stripe account? Even if you already have a Stripe account, you will set up a new one for Payments. This will be separate from any existing account you have with Stripe. What is a dispute or an inquiry and how do I handle them? A dispute (also known as a chargeback, inquiry, or retrieval) occurs when a cardholder questions your charge with their bank or card issuer. An inquiry or retrieval is solely a request for more information about the charge, which may escalate to a chargeback. To process a chargeback, the issuer creates a formal dispute which immediately reverses the payment. The payment amount and a separate $15.00 dispute fee (for users in the United States) are then deducted from your account balance.

The Finalsite Enrollment team can help you with supporting most aspects of Payments, including the following: Setting up your payment gateway for Payments Guiding you through the process of creating your account, onboarding, and adding your bank information on the Payments setup page For issues regarding the following, please contact Stripe directly: Issues completing the Stripe identity verification process (see the Verification section below for more information) Where do I find the ACH Company ID? You may need Stripe's ACH Company IDs to authorize direct debit with your bank. Stripe uses two company IDs to collect ACH debits and send ACH deposits on behalf of all users. 1800948598 - Stripe Payments Company 4270465600 - Stripe Payments Company Please refer to this article from Stripe for more information: ACH Direct Debit company IDs for Stripe Verification Why is identity verification required for the Payments setup process? Every country has its requirements that accounts must meet for Stripe to be able to pay out funds to individuals and companies. These are typically known as Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements. Regardless of the country, broadly speaking, the requirements Stripe must meet are: Collecting information about the individual or company receiving funds Verifying information to establish that we know who our customers are Finalsite Enrollment collects this information from your school during the onboarding step of the Payments setup process. This information is then provided to Stripe for verification purposes. Is the identity verification process immediate? In most applications, the account approval process is nearly instantaneous and you can accept payments immediately. If Stripe needs more information about your business or expects a longer delay in approving your account, they will reach out to you immediately. Why might the identity verification step fail? Will I get notified if it does? Verification will fail if the information provided on the form cannot be verified. For example, if the name provided does not match the full legal name on the account, or the business information provided could not be verified with the IRS. Return to Step 2 within the Payments setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments &gt; Step 2: Update Information) to see specifically what additional information is required. See the question below for the next steps. Whoever completes the verification step will receive an email if verification fails, and you can also monitor the \u2018Status\u2019 listed on the Payments setup page on your site. What are my next steps if verification fails? If your verification fails, your next step will be to return to the Payments setup page and retry Step 2 (\u2018Update Information\u2019) in the process. You can update the information if there are any mistakes in it. If Stripe is unable to verify your business and/or identity programmatically, you may be required to upload additional documentation. Accepted forms of identification for identity verification: Passport Passport card Driver license State-issued ID card Resident permit ID / U.S. Green Card Border crossing card Child ID card NYC card U.S. visa card Birth Certificate Accepted forms of identification for company/legal entity verification: IRS Letter 147C IRS SS-4 confirmation letter Why am I required to enter my social security number? SSN collection is required to comply with the \u2018Know Your Customer\u2019 laws passed by the federal government after 9/11. It is not something that we or Stripe can control. Additional Info on this: Customer Obligations Date of birth and Social Security Number (SSN) requirement for US Stripe accounts What is KYC Account Ownership How do I change the owner of my Payments account? There are several reasons why you may want to transfer ownership of your Payments account to someone else: Transfer account ownership to an existing Administrator Transfer account ownership to a current user on the account who does not have Administrator permissions Transfer ownership to an individual who does not yet have any access to the Payments account IMPORTANT: the account owner is the only one with access to make this adjustment. Return to the Payments setup page ( Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments) and use the \u2018Update Information\u2019 button underneath Step 2. From here, you can remove the existing business representative or update their information. How do I update my business details? You can update the business details for your school by returning to the Payments setup page ( Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments) and selecting the \u2018Update Information\u2019 button underneath Step 2. From here, you will have the option to update your business details. IMPORTANT: the account owner is the only one with access to make this adjustment. How can I change the Statement Descriptor (the text that displays next to the charge within a parent/payer's bank statement? You can edit/update the statement descriptor under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payment Setup. The Statement Descriptor box appears on all of the tabs under payment setup but you only need to edit it on one of the tabs and then save your update in order for it to take effect. Keep in mind You can list up to 19 characters. We recommend using your school name as the descriptor. How do I update my bank account number? To update the associated bank account for your school, please navigate to Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments . Select the \u2018Update Information\u2019 button underneath Step 2. You should receive a confirmation message. IMPORTANT: the account owner is the only one with access to make this adjustment. Payment Workflows How are funds transferred to my school? Once your account is fully set up and you start receiving payments, payouts of your available account balance will be initiated daily. If you would like to change your payout schedule to weekly (on any weekday M-F) or monthly (on a specific day) instead, please contact Finalsite Enrollment Support . Payments within those payouts are based on when they are processed. Processing Time 1-3 days for Credit Cards 4-7 business days for ACH/PAD payment Most banks deposit payouts into your bank account as soon as they are received, though some may take a few extra days to make them available. Please note: You must provide all required identity and business verification information before you can receive payouts. If you are not receiving payouts, your account may be missing information. What will families see on their bank account or credit card statements after they make a payment through Finalsite Enrollment? Your school's Statement Descriptor is what's used on bank accounts or credit card statements when a payment is made. The Statement Descriptor is set by default to the Business Website provided during the Payments onboarding/verification process. Example: Finalsite Enrollment.COM. You can edit the statement descriptor at any time within Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payment Setup . How can I issue a refund? Refund management is now built into your Payment History report in Finalsite Enrollment. Please see this page for details on issuing refunds with Payments. What is Autofill Link? Autofill Link is a payment method storage option provided by Stripe. During the payment process, parents can choose to use Autofill Link to securely save their payment information. This makes future payments easier by auto-filling their details, and they can also use this saved information on any website that supports Link.

    "body": "Overview What are Common Checklist Items? Common Checklist Items are checklist items that can be shared by applicants between schools within a designated group as part of the admissions process. A student applying to multiple schools in a school group can submit a recommendation, transcript request, and/or other AdHoc forms at one school, then, when applying to another school within the group, they'll have the option to share the form without having to complete it again. In this Article Setup and Notes Common Checklist Parent Experience Common Checklist Admin Experience Best Practices Troubleshooting Issues Setup and Notes What kinds of items can be used as Common Checklist items? You can set up Recommendation Forms, Transcript Requests, and AdHoc Forms. Important: You can not set up Inquiry, Application, or Contract Forms to be shared between schools. You need to know For Common Checklist items to function as expected, the following things must match between sites: The canonical name of the checklist item. The Start Term of the Checklist item. First Step: Get a group together and contact support To get set up, at least two Finalsite Enrollment schools must agree to participate in a group together and choose a group representative. The representative will be our point person for the initial setup. If you are a member of a group of schools looking to participate, please contact Support to discuss enabling this feature. Common Checklist Parent Experience Below is an example of how this will work for families. Please note: The student must be in an Applicant-type status at each school to link the forms. If the student is in a different type of status (e.g. Inquiry), the link forms option will not appear. Schools A, B, C, and D are members of a school group that have Common Checklist Items in Finalsite Enrollment. Applicant X submits an application to School A. They then complete their recommendation and transcript request forms at School A as well. Applicant X then decides to apply to School B. After submitting their application, they will see the option to link their recommendation and transcript request checklist items at School B to the ones they've already submitted at School A. After choosing to link their form at School B, they will select the correct checklist item to link to from School A. Once they have been linked, the corresponding checklist items at School B will show as linked to the forms at School A. After the form submitted at School A is completed, School B will update to show that it has been completed as well. Applicant X can then complete the same process at Schools C and D so that all four schools will receive the same recommendation and transcript request forms while the feeder school and teacher(s) only had to complete the form once. Pop some Popcorn! If you'd prefer to watch our video on this, you can check that out here, in our video library. Common Checklist Admin Experience Once the initial configuration is complete, you will be able to identify Common Checklist Items by the \"Common Checklist Item\" checkbox visible when editing a checklist item . Important Note: Please consult with Finalsite Enrollment before making any edits to, or creating a new Common Checklist Item. How will Common Checklist Items appear in the Admin Portal? Once a checklist item for an applicant has been linked to one or more schools, it will appear in the admin portal like so: The recommendation is accessible by clicking on \"Manage Files\" and downloading the associated PDF of the recommendation. If your school uses the Review module, linked recommendation forms will be accessible in there as well. Best Practices As mentioned above, the initial setup for Common Checklist Items should be performed by Finalsite Enrollment. When coordinating Common Checklist Items for a school group, it is best to have one point person for the group that works directly with Finalsite Enrollment. Edits made to a shared form will need to be made on each school\u2019s site within the group. So it's best to have one person submit this request to support to ensure edits are made to all sites. Note: each school still has the ability to make edits to their individual forms. If an edit is made to one school\u2019s form, that edit will be present when the form is shared with another school. Most schools add a common logo to all recommendation and transcript requests so that the administrator or teacher completing the form is aware that they are completing the form for all schools in the group. Note: There is only one recommendation request email template. If you are using shared recommendation forms and additional non-shared recommendation forms at your school, the email sent to the administrator or teacher will be the same for both. Troubleshooting Issues Here are some common issues you may encounter when working with Common Checklist Items and our suggestions for how to solve them. Issue: The checklist item doesn't include the sharing option. If the parent doesn't see the Link Common Form option within the expected checklist item, it may be related to the following: Internal Naming Issue: The canonical name of the checklist item must match for the checklist item to appear in the linking list. Fix: Contact Support. Our team will need to evaluate the issue and offer solutions. Term does not match: The start term of the checklist item must match in for the item to appear as a option in the linking list. Fix: Contact Support . Our team will need to evaluate the issue and offer solutions. Portal email : Parent logins are the same across all sites. Therefore, when a parent has an account at one school, they do not need to create an account for the next school. They need to simply log in using the credentials set up for the other site. If they aren't logging in with the same email/password on all sites in the group, they won't be able to see the sharing options. Also to Note: I f a password is changed for one site it will be changed for all and, with password updates, parents should keep an eye on whether their auto-saved password is updated on all school portal sites. Fix: Parents must log in to each school with the same email address and password. We also recommend adding instructions to the Portal Login page to communicate this to parents. Learn more about updating templates on pages like the login page within our Parent Portal Content article. Issue: Fields not populating correctly If the fields within your shared forms are not populating correctly, it may be rooted in one of the following causes: Field values do not match: The values within the fields in your shared forms must be consistent across all sites. Real World Example: You have a single select field on one of your shared forms. The options within the field are: red, yellow, and blue. Every school that is part of your common checklist group must also use the values of: red, yellow, and blue within that field on their site in order for it to function properly. If one of the schools is instead using the values of: cadmium red, yellow, and blue, the system will not be able to properly communicate about the data. Fix: Align with the other schools in your group to ensure that the values in the fields within your shared forms are the same. Field canonicals on forms do not match: The canonical (internal) name of the fields within the form must match the canonicals in the other group member's form. Fix: Contact Support . Our team will need to evaluate the issue and offer solutions.

From there, simply check the 'Impersonate' box for any accounts you want to have access to this feature. -- How-To: Use the Impersonate Feature Once Impersonate is enabled for your account, you can now impersonate the login session of any parent with an associated Parent Portal account. To do this, open the contact record of a student in the system, click the \u201cHouseholds\u201d tab, then click \u201cParent Portal Access.\u201d There will be an \u201cImpersonate\u201d button located in the \u201cLinked Account\u201d column for any parent account associated with that contact. To view their parent portal, click the \u201cImpersonate\u201d button. When you click the Impersonate button, you will be signed out of your current session and start a new login session impersonating the parent. The new session will appear in a new browser window or tab, depending on your individual browser settings. At this point, you will be able to see everything in the parent portal as the parent would see it. You\u2019ll be able to complete most actionable items a parent would, such as submit forms, upload files and schedule calendar appointments. However, you will not be able to submit a contract, or submit a payment with saved payment profile information. To return to the Finalsite Enrollment app, you will need to sign out of your parent login session. To do that, click the \u201cSign Out\u201d button in the top red bar of the browser. Then, sign back into your Finalsite Enrollment app as usual.

    "body": "Overview NSF Fees are charged for payments that fail due to insufficient funds. A $25 charge is collected when this occurs. You have the option to: Absorb the $25 fee. Pass the full charge along to the payer. Pass part of the charge along to the payer. If you choose to absorb the fee, no additional setup is required. If you choose to pass along the full charge or a portion of it to the payer, some setup is necessary. Work with our Support team to set up and manage NSFs. Important Notes Fees for Insufficient Funds (NSF fees) that you pass along to payers must be set up and managed by our team. If you have questions about your setup, please reach out to our Support team . If you are using Autopay and have enabled Retry Failed Autopay Payments on the Billing Setup page, NSF Fees will only charged for the first failed payment. If it fails again, NSF fees will not be charged again. For more information regarding this feature, please refer to the Retry Failed Autopay Payments article. Setting Up NSF Fees Contact Support with the following information: The amount you'd like to charge for the NSF fee. Full charge = $25 You can also opt to charge more or less than the $25 fee. The Billing Category that you'd like to assign the NSF to. Please note: As a best practice, the Billing Category for NSF fees should be set up as an Account Level charge. You might already have this set up on your site. If you aren't sure please, contact support and we can let you know! How NSF Charges Work In Finalsite Enrollment Example workflow of a failed payment: ACH payment made by a parent on 2/21. The payment fails on 2/25. The failed payment chargeback will post to the parent's ledger on the original date the payment was made, which was 2/21 in this example. The NSF fee will be post on the day that the payment failed, which is 2/25. Ledger Lock Note The Ledger Lock feature lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on or before the set date. It's set up in the Billing Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). Here's how the Ledger Lock affects failed payment behavior If the original date is within the locked range, both the chargeback and NSF fee will be posted to the ledger with the current date instead of the original payment date.

    "body": "Overview One of the benefits of Payments is the ability to issue full or partial refunds to parents/guardians directly within the Finalsite Enrollment system. Electronic check or credit card payments can be refunded from the Payment History page. Refunds are first deducted from any available funds in your account that have not been paid out to your bank. If your account balance is $0, funds will be pulled directly from your connected bank account. Click here for an Overview &amp; FAQs on Payments. Time limits for processing refunds: Refunds for Credit Card Payments must be initiated within 90 days from the original payment date. Refunds for ACH payments must be initiated within 180 days from the original payment date. IMPORTANT: parent accounts saved before moving over to Payments (from Stripe Legacy) only have a 90-day window in which ACH refunds can be processed. In this Article How-To: Refund a Payment Refunds Deductions and Ledger Behavior Failed Refunds Convenience Fees Safeguards How-To: See who made a refund and when it was issued How-To: Refund a Payment Please Note You must enable refunds under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments before you can process them. If you have not enabled refunds, you will see an error when you attempt to issue one. To enable refunds, you will complete step 1 on the Payments page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payments.) If you do not see an error when attempting a refund on this page and you've already completed Step 1 on the payments page, you can proceed with the steps below. Refunds can be issued from the Payment History page, found within Settings &gt; Financial in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Within the Payment History page, locate the payment that you want to refund in the list by browsing or using the Search Options menu to narrow down the list based on criteria such as name or transaction number. After locating the payment you want to refund, click the down arrow next to Show, then select Issue Refund. The Refund Payment window will open. In this window, you can select the Reason for the refund (Duplicate, Customer Requested, Fraudulent, or Other) and whether you want to refund the Full Amount or a Partial Amount. If you select to refund a partial amount, you will be asked to input the specific amount you want to refund. Note: If you issue a partial refund for a payment, you can still issue additional refunds for it later until the full amount of the transaction is refunded. If there are multiple billing categories in the payment, you will be able to enter the amount you want to refund from each. For example, if the payment included Tuition and Deposit, you could refund $50 from Deposit and $50 from Tuition. Click Submit once you have made your selections. You will then be asked to confirm the amount of and reason for the refund. Review the information, and then click Confirm to complete the refund. Please note that refunds can take 5-10 days to appear on a statement. The original payment will remain on the Payment History page. Within the Payment Details window (accessible by clicking on Show to the right of the payment), you can view the details of the original purchase as well as the refund under the Transactions heading. Refunds Deductions and Ledger Behavior Deductions Refunds are first deducted from any available funds in your account that have not been paid out to your bank. In the event that your account balance is $0, funds will be pulled directly from your connected bank account. Any fees incurred by disputes or ACH failures will also be collected in this manner. Ledger Behavior Payment: When a refund occurs, the payment is automatically added back to the ledger by the system as a negative payment. Charge: The original charge remains on the ledger because it might still be owed. If it is not owed, the charge should be canceled out with a negative charge or deleted. Example of a refund as it appears on the parent's ledger: Ledger Lock Note The Ledger Lock feature lets you secure your financial records by setting a locked date. Once enabled, it prevents any alterations to the ledger entries dated on or before the set date. It's set up in the Billing Setup page (Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Billing Setup). Here's how the Ledger Lock affects refund behavior If the original date is within the locked range, the refund will be posted to the ledger with the current date instead of the original payment date. Read more about Ledger Lock and how it affects other areas of your site in our Settings: Billing Setup Page article. Failed Refunds When a refund fails, the following will happen automatically: The refunded amount is automatically sent back to the bank account connected to your Payments account. If you have enabled the Failed Payments notification email enabled (which is turned on in the User Notifications page), you will automatically receive the Failed Refund Notification email . In addition to the above, you'll be able to see the failed refund recorded in the following places within the site: Parent Ledger The failed refund is added back to the ledger as a Payment. As a reminder, when you process a refund, it's added to the ledger as a negative payment. When a refund fails, it's added back to the ledger as a (positive) payment to balance out the ledger. Example of a failed refund as it appears on the parent's ledger: Payment History Report: Within the Payment History Report, when you select Show, you will see a full history of the refund, including the failure reason. Failure Reasons You can see a list of the failure reasons and their descriptions within this Stripe article: Refund and Cancel Payments in the Handle Failed Refunds section. You can also filter the Payment History Report to only show failed refunds. How to Filter by Failed Refunds in the Payment History Report: Open the Search Options dropdown. From the Status dropdown, select Refund Failed . Click Search. Payout Report: All transactions related to the failed refund will be recorded in the Payout Report. Convenience Fees When refunding a credit card or ACH/PAD payment, the full amount includes the convenience fee. If you want to give the family back the fee as well as the amount, select full refund on any credit card or ACH payment. Important While the convenience fee can be refunded to a family, it is not refunded to your bank account. Therefore, when you refund a family the full amount, you are accepting the loss of the convenience fee amount. If you do not wish to absorb the fee, you need to select partial refund and enter the max amount next to each category of the payment. This will total the full amount less the convenience fee. In the example below, you would set the Enrollment Deposit Refund to 100.0 and the Tuition Refund Plan to 15.40. Safeguards As an internal safeguard, refunds will automatically turn off in the event of large usage that is unexpected. If this happens you can contact support . They will verify that the account is in good standing, the refunds are authorized, and that the account is connected to direct debit. After a quick check, refunds will be re-enabled. How-To: See who made a refund and when it was issued You can view an audit of who processed a refund within Finalsite Enrollment and when it was issued within the Payment History page. On the right side of the page, selecting Show will open the Payment Details dialogue box. Within this pop-up, you will have access to view the Transaction History of the refund, including the following data: The Type column will say Refund. The Time column will display the timestamp of the refund. The Message column starts with Refunded, followed by the reason that the Admin selected when initially issuing the refund. The Refunded By column will display the username of the admin who issued the refund.

    "body": "Overview Schools or groups who purchase multiple different Finalsite Enrollment sites may choose to organize them in a Supersite/Subsite configuration. Some examples include: Diocese schools Schools with multiple campuses or locations Setting a Supersite/Subsite configuration grants admins and users on the Supersite access to some extra functionality, such as the subsite picker, auto-created accounts on all subsites, and roll-up funnel reporting. Read on below for more information. How-To: Use Supersite Functionality Quickly navigate to Subsites from the Supersite One of the primary functions of the Supersite is to allow admins/users on the site to easily jump to any of the linked subsites. Supersite users can click the icon in the upper right of the admin portal to see a picklist of all linked subsites. Clicking on any of the schools in this list will take the user directly to the admin portal for that subsite. Inherited Admin Portal Accounts and permissions on all Subsites Admin Portal Accounts created on the Supersite will be cascaded down to all Subsites, so that Supersite users don't have to manually create accounts on each of the Subsites. In addition, the Subsite account permissions will be inherited from the Supersite account. When viewing the Admin Portal Accounts page for a Subsite, any accounts that were inherited from the Supersite will have 'Supersite' listed in the Source column. Accounts that were created directly on the Subsite will have a blank Source column. Please note: Account information and permissions for accounts inherited from the Supersite cannot be edited from a Subsite. To make changes, go to the Admin Portal Accounts page on the Supersite. Roll-up funnel reporting on Supersites On the Supersite, a special report called the Funnel Report will be available within the Search &amp; Reports tab. This report aggregates and displays admissions funnel data from all Subsite schools so that you can view each school's progress towards their enrollment goals, as well as your total numbers across all schools, at a glance. There are two views for the report. The default view compares the numbers from the selected year to the previous year. Clicking the percentage sign (%) button in the top right corner switches to a view that shows conversion, selectivity, yield, and retention percentages for each school as students move through the funnel. To export the funnel report into a .CSV file, click the Export button towards the upper right corner. The file will download automatically when it's ready. Learn more!

    "body": "Overview Merge fields, also known as tokens, can be used to pull dynamic information from contacts in Finalsite Enrollment into various parts of the system. To learn more about the various uses for merge fields, click here . Authentication codes and links are used to link a student's record/checklist to a Parent Portal Account. By using authentication merge fields, you can easily send communications to parents/guardians, letting them know how to authenticate and log into their accounts to access their student's checklist. How-To: Use Authentication Merge Fields Merge fields can be added to a template through the Merge Field Picker or by typing/copying them directly into the template's body. Learn more in our 'How to Pull in Dynamic Information' section here . Below are some of the key authentication-related merge fields available to you: Verification Link Pulls in the unique authentication link for the recipient, so that they can click to link their Parent Portal Account to the associated student. This token will render a clickable link once sent. Please note that this token uses recipient instead of contact since the verification link is for the parent/guardian and not the student. Category: Recipient Merge Field: {{recipient.verification_link}} Example: http://demo.schooladminonline.com/portal/authenticate/cd7y1y1 Please note: this merge token should not be hyperlinked. It should always be inserted using the merge token picker tool rather than copying/pasting it. Hyperlinking the token could cause it to malfunction. Authentication Code Pulls in the unique authentication code for the recipient, so they can copy and paste it into the Parent Portal (after clicking 'Enter authentication code' ) to link their Parent Portal Account to the associated student. Please note that this token uses recipient instead of contact since the authentication code is for the parent/guardian and not the student. Category: Recipient Merge Field: {{recipient.authentication_code}} Example: cd7y1y1 Parent Portal URL This populates the direct link to your school's Parent Portal login page. This token will render a clickable link once sent. Category: School Merge Field: {{school.parent_portal_url}} Example: https://demo.schooladminonline.com/portal Portal Email Pulls in the authenticated portal email for the recipient, if one exists. This token is useful for emailing parents/guardians - you can display the email address they used to create their account, in case they forget or if it's different from their contact email. Please note that this token uses recipient instead of contact since the portal email refers to the parent/guardian and not the student. Category: Recipient Merge Field: {{recipient.portal_email}} Example: shelly.miller@gmail.com Parent 1 Name Pulls in the name of the person listed as Parent 1 for the selected contact. This is useful if you want to email consultants, but include the parent's name. Example: The authentication code for {{contact.parent1.name}} is {{contact.parent1.authentication_code}}. Please note that this token is not available in the merge token picker - you must enter it manually. Category: N/A - Manual Entry Merge Field: {{contact.parent1.name}} Example: Shelly Miller Parent 2 Name Pulls in the name of the person listed as Parent 2 for the selected contact.

Category: N/A - Manual Entry Merge Field: {{contact.parent2.authentication_code}} Example: 2cf4f010 Examples for Communication Templates As mentioned above, the authentication merge fields are useful for crafting communications (e.g. emails) to your applying or enrolling families, so that you can instruct them how to successfully navigate and log in to the Parent Portal. Parent Portal Access/Login Information Your Parent Portal Account Login Email: {%if recipient.portal_email != blank%}{{recipient.portal_email}} - If this email address is incorrect or if you would like to change it: Please contact us directly so we can update it for you. - If you forgot your login password: Click on the \u201cForgot your password?\u201d link on the Parent Portal Login Page and enter the email address above to receive a password reset email. {%else%}Not yet created - please go here and create an account.{%endif%} This example uses a logic statement (in Liquid ) to output different text depending on whether the recipient already authenticated their Parent Portal Account or not. If the recipient's account is authenticated (i.e. their Portal Email is not blank), they will see the bullet points starting with \"If this email address is incorrect...\" and \"If you forgot your login password...\" If the recipient's account is not authenticated (i.e. their Portal Email is blank), they will see the message \"Not yet created - please go here and create an account.\" Use the {{school.parent_portal_url}} token as the URL for the words \"go here\" to provide an easy way for the recipient to click through to your school's Parent Portal. Authentication Email to Consultant Dear {{recipient.first_name}}, Below, you will find the information to authenticate the Parent Portal Account(s) for the parent/guardian(s) of {{contact.first_name}}. Parent/Guardian 1 Name: {{contact.parent1.name}} Authentication Code: {{contact.parent1.authentication_code}} {%if contact.parent2.name != blank%} Parent/Guardian 2 Name: {{contact.parent2.name}} Authentication Code: {{contact.parent2.authentication_code}} {%endif%} Select Consultants from the recipient options when sending this email. This message addresses the Consultant by first name. The token {{contact.first_name}} will pull in the first name of the associated student. The name and authentication code for Parent/Guardian 1 will be pulled in first. If there is a Parent/Guardian 2 (i.e. if the name field for Parent2 is not blank), their name and authentication code will be pulled in after that. General Link to Parent Portal The Parent Portal is where you can access any pending checklist items for {{school.long_name}} - click here to go there now. Use the {{school.parent_portal_url}} token as the URL for the words \"click here\" or \"Parent Portal\" to provide an easy way for the recipient to click through to your school's Parent Portal.

This report includes the following columns: Charged - All contractual charges plus any incidental charges Credited - All contractual credits plus any incidental credits Paid in School - All payments manually entered by the school, including deposit payments within the checklist Paid Online - All base amount payments made electronically Convenience Fee - The convenience fee charged to payers Balance - The sum of all charges, credits, and payments Pending - Electronic payments that have not been remitted yet Platform Fee - Enrollment based fee for application and deposit payments Merchant Fee - The sum of platform fees with the addition of the payment processing fee Remitted - The net amount of electronic payments that have transferred into your school's bank account. The entire page is exportable to a CSV format, it will also include the sum totals at the bottom of the export. -- Important Notes There are a couple of minor differences for those who are using different payment processors, Stripe legacy or Payments. For Payments: As soon as a payment is made, you will be able to see that payment within this report along with the associated fees. For Stripe Legacy: Once a payment is made, it will not shown up immediately on this report, it will take at least a day for it to show up, along with the associated fees. This will also apply to refunds and failed payments. For Either Processor: Since payment related fees are not tied to a student but on the payer, Convenience fees, Platform fees, and Merchant fees will always show up whether you filter this report by date or term.",

    "body": "Overview Online Forms are a great way to collect information electronically so that you can later search and report on it, or use it to drive checklist items, contract fees, or customized text. Online Forms can be parent/student-facing so that families can fill them out in the Parent Portal, or they can be internal-only so that your team can input information such as interview notes onto a student's contact record. Who has access to add and edit forms? Types: System Admin and Admins Permissions: Any In this Article Basic vs Advanced Editor Notes on Updating in the Advanced Editor Fields &amp; Mapping Field Displays Comment Fields Additional Resources Basic vs Advanced Editor Basic Form Editor To edit text on a form such as header text, sub-header text, and comment field text, use the basic form editor. Further Learning! Read more about the Basic Forms Editor here: Forms: Basic Form Editor (Text Edits) You may also want to check out our Intro to Forms video which covers the Basic Editor. Advanced Form Editor For more complex edits such as editing/adding field dependencies, adding/removing/rearranging questions, and more, use the Advanced form editor. Notes on Updating in the Advanced Editor Don't be intimidated by the Advanced Editor! Here's what you need to know to get started... Fields &amp; Mapping Online Forms in Finalsite Enrollment are primarily made up of fields - essentially the data or information that you're collecting from your families on forms (e.g. 'Current School' or 'Gender') or internally on a student record (e.g. 'President's Scholarship Amount) about contacts in the system. Read on below for some key information to know about fields on online forms. Fields can be mapped to different entities in the system, such as CHILD or PARENT1-4. This mapping determines which contact the data entered into that field will write to in the system. Most fields will be mapped to CHILD, which refers to the student. Example 1: I want to collect the Date of Birth for the Student who is applying, so I should map the birth_date field to the CHILD entity on my form. Example 2: I want to collect the Alumni Status for the Primary Parent , so I should map the is_alumni field to the PARENT1 entity on my form. ALL fields on an online form should be mapped to an entity. If a field is left unmapped, the data entered into that field will not write through to the contact, and you will not be able to search on, display, or use that data in the system. The only exceptions to this rule are Signature Fields and Additional Signature Fields , which should always be UNMAPPED so that they do not pre-populate on subsequent forms. Home addresses should always be mapped to HOUSEHOLD1 or HOUSEHOLD2 so that households are created in the system. Additional address fields - such as school address or grandparents' address - can be mapped to the student. Field Displays The fields in your Finalsite Enrollment site will be named with a friendly Display Name (e.g. 'Current School'), as well as a Canonical Name made up of all lowercase letters and underscores (e.g. 'edu_current_school_ss'). When someone is filling out an Online Form, they will not see the field display name or canonical name. Instead, they will see the Prompt that was entered for that field when setting up the form. Prompts are the questions that you ask on your forms and the wording of these questions are customized by you - see Editing Online Forms for more. Example In this example, we are using the field with the canonical name previous_school_2_yn . However, the person filling out the form will only see what we've entered in the Prompt box - in this case, \"Has the applicant attended another school in the past?\"... Comment Fields In addition to data fields, your online forms can also contain Comment Fields , where you can input any text or content you want to display on the form (e.g. terms and conditions, links to other pages or documents, images). HTML/CSS , Liquid , and Merge Fields/Tokens are supported in Comment Fields, so you can use them for customization or pulling in dynamic information from student (or related contact) records. Comment Fields can also be useful for longer field prompts, based on your display preference. Place the prompt in a CommentField above the question, then use a short generic prompt (e.g. 'Response') for the field itself. See example below.

    "body": "Overview Learning how to best organize your billing ledger items for both students and parents/payers is important for your ledger and reporting needs. This article will outline best practices for setting up your Billing Category Groups and offer some guidance on organizing your Billing Categories within these groups. Please note: While this article contains information for all schools, some parts of the FAQs will only apply to schools utilizing our Billing module. Terminology Billing Category Groups: Billing Category Groups are like folders that can hold and organize multiple categories of charges and credits. See the 'Best Practices for Setup' section below for recommendations on what groups you should create. Important Note: Each Billing Category Group (folder) does not communicate with other billing category groups (folders). The groups lay the groundwork for how our system\u2019s payment logic works. Billing Categories: A Billing Category is an individual charge or credit that's either on the contract such as a tuition amount or financial aid amount, or that's added as an ad-hoc charge or credit after contract signing such as a sports fee, aftercare, or a late fee. Billing categories are organized within billing category groups. Best Practice: You should create a billing category for every charge or credit that you need in ledgers and reports. Multiple billing categories can be assigned to each billing category group. Click here to learn more. Example of a 'Tuition &amp; Fees' billing category group expanded to show the billing categories (individual charges) within: Best Practices for Setup We recommend having the following billing category groups: Tuition &amp; Fees Group Account-Level Fees Group Incidentals Group Prepaid Group Keep in mind: The names of your billing category groups (folders) are customizable and they do not need to match our examples. However, if you would like to make changes to the group name (not billing category name) to match our examples or have something unique, it will not affect anything negatively or interrupt your reporting. Note: You can also make changes to the billing category names (charges &amp; credits), which will update all retroactive charges and credits in ledgers and reports. However, please note the payment names will not update retroactively to match the credits and charges. See the 'Common Questions' section below for more information. You can create additional groups as needed. There are additional settings within the Group setup (Revenue Recognition, Allocation, and Exclusion from Overpayment Logic). You can learn more about those settings, here. Important Note about Billing Category Order Make sure you arrange each Billing Category Group and the Billing Categories within each group in the order that you would like charges and credits to be applied. To move billing categories and groups, simply drag and drop them to the desired position. Autopay payments and manual payments will always be applied to any current or outstanding billing categories first, and then continue down the list in the order of any categories that have amounts due or overdue. Below we'll cover more details on best practices for each group, what they should contain and how to set them up. Tuition &amp; Fees Group A Tuition &amp; Fees Billing Category Group should contain all of your major charge and credit categories like tuition, financial aid, scholarships, book fees, etc. This group should have the \" apply to student balance \" option checked . If you have multiple tuition amounts, they can all be included in this group and named as needed (for example, Lower School Tuition, Middle School Tuition, Upper School Tuition). All discounts on tuition such as all financial aid and scholarships should be included in this group. Additionally, you should include your one-time student fee categories like library or field trip fees under this group. Setup Billing Category Group Name: Tuition &amp; Fees Group Billing Categories: All tuition categories, all student aid and scholarship categories, all one-time student fee categories, and anything else you are charging on the contract. Apply to Student Balance: Yes (check it off) -- Account-Level Fees Group (Fees that apply only to the parent/payer) A Billing Category Group for account-level fees should contain any fees that apply to parents or payers, not students. The most common examples of account-level fees are Late fees and NSF fees. Very Important: This group should not have the \" apply to student balance \" option checked. The most common Account-level fees are: Late Fees and NSF Fees Setup Billing Category Group Name: Account-Level Fees Billing Categories: Late Fee, NSF Fee, any other fee that only applies at the account level. Apply to Student Balance: No (leave it blank) -- Incidentals Group An \"Incidentals\" Billing Category Group should contain any other fees that don't need to roll up to tuition and shouldn't have discounts applied. You can think of incidentals as fees that are added throughout the year rather than as a one-time charge. They are fees that shouldn\u2019t have credits from tuition applied to them. This group should have the \" apply to student balance \" option checked . Setup Billing Category Group Name: Student Fees (No Aid) Billing Categories: Any recurring incidental fee added throughout the year. Apply to Student Balance: Yes (check it off) Prepaid Group The Prepaid Group (and the Prepaid billing category within the group) are built into your site in order to automatically handle prepayments. You can read more about prepayments here . Important: Some schools will have the Prepaid category listed under the Parent Fee grouping as opposed to it being listed within its own Prepaid Group. This is completely fine. For the prepaid category, the important part is that it's set up to not be applied to the student balance, whether that means it's within its own Prepaid group, or, under the umbrella of the Parent Fees group . Setup Billing Category Group Name: Prepaid Billing Categories: Prepaid Apply to Student Balance: No Common Questions Can I change billing categories at any point in the year? Yes, please keep in mind that all changes will be reflected going forward and, while charges and credits will have the changes made reflected retroactively, payments will not which will cause a discrepancy in the reporting. Can I have different scholarships? Yes, you can work with support so they can create custom scholarship fields, and then you\u2019ll need to create matching billing categories (not groups) for each of these different scholarships. Each scholarship category should be set up within your main Tuition &amp; Fees group and should be set up as a credit category. What happens if I change the name of a Billing Category? If you change the name of a Billing Category, it will update the name of that charge or credit in the ledger retroactively, for all prior posted credits and charges. The change will also be reflected on all current and future credits, charges, and payments. Please keep in mind that the change will not be reflected on past payments, which will cause a discrepancy in your reporting. Will changes made to Billing Categories affect the payout report? Changes made to the billing category setup page such as the order of any categories or sub-categories will only affect payments going forward in the payout report. All previous charges and credits will remain as is. Will changes made to Billing Categories affect the billing date? Payments are applied to the oldest charges or credits first and then will continue to be applied to any current charges, as per the billing category order. Is there any way to override the order that Finalsite Enrollment applies a payment? Not currently. Parents make payments in the portal and they get applied according to the billing category order and any outstanding/current amounts first. Admins can manually adjust which category a payment is applied to after it's been posted. Read how to do that here , under the ' Adjusting a payment to go to a different billing category and/or student ' section. If you'd like some additional guidance on setup, please contact our best-in-class Support team for all questions and assistance.

    "body": "Overview Although parents/guardians can make online payments from their Parent Portal, there may still be times when you need to collect payment over the phone. Some examples include: Making a payment on behalf of someone who is experiencing technical difficulties or otherwise has trouble accessing the Parent Portal. Billing payers requesting one-time or additional payments over the phone with schools (e.g. families want a bi-monthly payment cadence or receive a lump sum such as a tax refund that they'd like to apply). Grandparents who want to contribute to their grandchild's education. To support these scenarios and more, learn how to process manual payments using Payments by reading on below. IMPORTANT NOTES/LIMITATIONS: At this time, you can only pay with a Credit Card when making a payment on behalf of a parent. You can not make Electronic Check or ACH payments when making payments for parents while impersonating. For security purposes, the system doesn't allow Admins to enroll families in Autopay. You can not make a payment with a saved payment profile on behalf of the parent/payer. All payments made by the Admin MUST be entered manually. If your school has AutoPay set as required, a manual payment made by the Admin is only allowed if: The family already has a saved payment profile set to AutoPay. The Admin can then enter and process a manual payment for the same payer or for a different payer, such as another parent or a grandparent. How-To: Process a Manual Payment with Payments Processing a payment on behalf of a parent/guardian or other payer requires use of the impersonate feature within Finalsite Enrollment. Please note: You must have the impersonate permission enabled from within 'Settings' - 'Portal' - 'Admin Portal Accounts' to do this. 1 - Access the contact record of the student who needs the payment You can do this by selecting the student from a list page/search or by using the quick search action . 2 - Click into the 'Households' tab - 'Parent Portal Access' . You can also access this page using the quick link on the contact record summary. This is the computer monitor icon to the right of the page (underneath parent/guardian contact information). 3 - Find the contact in the list, then click the ' Impersonate ' button in the 'Linked Account' column to begin impersonating their account. Please note: This step requires that the parent/guardian who you want to make a payment on behalf of has their Parent Portal Account authenticated. Once you have clicked the Impersonate button, you will be redirected to the Parent Portal - My Students page and be logged in as the parent selected. 4 - Access Billing Management tab and make a payment The Billing Management tab will be at the top of the page on the Parent Portal. Click on it to access the area where you can make a payment. Once you are on the Billing Management tab, you will see the billing accounts, amounts due, and ledger. You will also see the green Make Payment button in the accounts section - click on this to make the payment on behalf of the payer. On the Make a Payment page, you can choose the amount to pay (Current Balance or enter a custom amount), then enter the payment method information you received from the parent/guardian. Please note: For security purposes, you will not be able to make a payment with a saved payment profile. After entering the payment information, click the Pay button at the bottom to complete the transaction. The parent/guardian will receive the automated payment received email (if payment is successful) or payment failed email (if there is an error). Please note that the failed payment email is only something available to schools using the Billing module.

    "body": "Overview Schools using Finalsite Enrollment for Admissions and Veracross for Enrollment may want to consider using the one-way Finalsite Enrollment to Veracross integration. This integration can be configured to send Finalsite Enrollment admissions data to Veracross, and saves time on tasks like manually exporting or importing data to create applicant records, updating records, or updating contact info in Veracross. Please note that there is an additional charge for this integration. If you are interested in setting it up, please contact our Support Team to get started. Admissions &amp; Enrollment Process Admissions The Admissions Process is managed within Finalsite Enrollment, however, Veracross has the school build out their admissions process within Veracross so that the integration will work. Enrollment: Which System Do I Use? The Enrollment Process can be managed within Finalsite Enrollment with the integration, or it can be managed solely within Veracross. It depends what makes more sense to the Admin, and which product is easier for parents and Admins to use for Enrollment. If your school would like to use Finalsite Enrollment for Enrollment, you can work with the Support Team to build a custom export of enrolled student data. Once the data has been pushed to Veracross, the school will need to update the statuses of NEW students to enrolled within the Veracross system. Important Integration Notes Relationship data: The integration process establishes the relationship for the student, linking them as a child to their parents and as a sibling to their brothers and sisters. In other words, it only connects the student you import to their parents and siblings. The siblings and parents themselves are not connected to one another. For example, You import the following family: Agatha Miller (student) Margaret Miller (sister) Louis Miller (brother) Clarisa Boehmer (mother) Fredrick Miller (father) Upon Import, Agatha is connected as the child of Clarisa and Fredrick and the sibling of Louis and Margaret, but Louis and Margaret themselves are not connected as siblings, and, on the same thread, Clarisa and Fredrick are not connected to one another as spouses. For more information on relationship management, you can check out this Veracross article. Ids: To ensure seamless integration across systems and avoid potential issues, it is crucial that IDs match consistently. Students must maintain the same ID in both Finalsite Enrollment and Veracross. This alignment of IDs between the two systems is essential for smooth data synchronization and to prevent any discrepancies or complications that might arise. Data Points : Click here to review the specific list of data that can be sent from Finalsite Enrollment to Veracross. If you require the ability to send additional data beyond what is listed, our dedicated support team can create a custom export tailored to your needs. For more information about creating a custom export, we encourage you to explore our comprehensive article: Custom Data Services: Data Export to SIS &amp; 3rd Party Systems . There, you can find details about the expected timeline and requirements for this service, enabling you to make informed decisions based on your unique requirements. Finalsite Enrollment to Veracross Integration: Setup &amp; Responsibilities Once your school has purchased the integration, you can begin the setup process. This integration uses the new Veracross API, so users with the OAuth_App_Admin role can begin the setup themselves from the Identity &amp; Access Management homepage in Axiom. Customer Responsibilities Add Finalsite Enrollment as an Integration Partner in Veracross and start the integration Inform the Finalsite Enrollment Support Team via email once complete so that we have access to the Client ID and Client Secret in the Veracross Partner Portal Collaborate with Finalsite Enrollment Configuration Team to get the export configuration set up to meet your data needs (ongoing) Run exports in Finalsite Enrollment to push to Veracross as needed Finalsite Enrollment Responsibilities Complete set up of integration in Finalsite Enrollment using customer-specific credentials from Veracross Create export configuration used to export data out of Finalsite Enrollment into Veracross Provide support throughout the setup process and handle troubleshooting of any issues related to the export Related Articles Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Running a Data Export in Finalsite Enrollment",

    "body": "Overview This article provides a general overview of the concepts underlying the Finalsite Enrollment API and how to best use the API for success. The Finalsite Enrollment API is built on RESTful principles and is meant for retrieving information from a specific Finalsite Enrollment site. At this time, the Finalsite Enrollment API is read-only, meaning only GET requests are accepted and no data can be written to the system via the API. The API is only accessible through HTTPS. Important Notes and Considerations: Our Support team is not able to assist with the development of this feature. Access to the API is an add-on. Please contact your client success manager if you would like to purchase access. Most schools work with a programming engineer to help them build the API to map to their desired third party. Once you have been approved and paid for the External API, a member of the Finalsite Enrollment team will enable the feature for you. Once enabled, any System Admin with Data permissions will be able to access the External API Documentation and Credentials from within Settings &gt; Fields &amp; Data. In this article Authentication Content-Type Expandable Attributes Pagination Rate Limiting Response Statuses Versioning Authentication The API uses JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to authenticate requests. An API credential ID and API secret are required to create a valid JWT. The ID identifies an API credential belonging to an API user and is used as part of generating the token. The secret is used to sign the token. The JWT must be generated with the following claims and signed with the corresponding secret: {\"sub\": \"api_credential_id\", \"name\": \"human readable name that identifies the calling program\", \"exp\": \"expiration time in seconds since epoch\"} Expiration Time This field specifies when the token will expire. Value is a Unix Epoch Timestamp - The number of seconds that have elapsed since January 1st 1970, 12:00:00 AM UTC The expiration can be no more than sixty minutes in the future. Authorization Header The generated token must then be included in the Authorization header as Bearer token , for example: Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IlJvZ2VyIFdpbGNvIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.2fA2T6_92g3xomqL0IjrW_6XMBafS9uU1LRGRaAUmKE Content-Type The API returns all responses as JSON. Expandable Attributes Some endpoints support optional attributes, which might include deeper information about related objects. Objects marked as x-expandable in endpoint documentation can be included or excluded using the includes and excludes request parameters. For example, the contacts endpoint includes information minimal information about each contact's relatives by default. A full Contact object for each relative can be optionally included by specifying the ?includes=contacts.relationships.contact request parameter. Pagination Endpoints with pagination will return a maximum of 100 objects. When more than 100 objects are returned, the response will include a meta key containing a next_cursor , for example: {meta: {next_cursor: 'MjVkMjE3NDctM2MwYS0xMWVjLThlMGEtMDI0MmFjMTIwMDA1'}} This cursor must be included as a query param in the next request with the key cursor in order to retrieve the next set of results. When there are no more results, the next_cursor will be returned as nil. Rate Limiting Requests to the API are rate-limited to a rate of 15 requests per 10 seconds. Requests that exceed this limit will return a 429 response with a Retry-After header specifying how long to wait before the next request. Response Statuses The API uses the following standard HTTP response statuses. Status Code Description 200 OK The request succeeded. The body of the response should be a json object with the requested data. 401 Unauthorized The authorization data provided was not valid. 404 Not Found The requested resource could not be found. You may be trying to access a record that does not exist, or you may have supplied an invalid URL. 429 Too Many Requests You will see this response if you've exceeded the rate limit. This response should include a Retry-After (see Rate Limiting ). 500 Internal Server Error An unexpected error has occurred. This response should include a JSON error object describing what went wrong. Versioning The API uses a single major version number. This version number is incremented whenever breaking changes are introduced. This version is an integer, specified with the header X-Api-Version . For example: X-Api-Version: 1 It is always recommended to use the latest version of an endpoint available. The version will not be updated when the following occurs: Non-breaking, backwards-compatible change are introduced New attributes are added to a result Validations are added to prevent bad data from entering the system Related Articles Custom Data Services: Data Export to SIS &amp; 3rd Party Systems",

    "body": "Overview During the rollover process for returning students, many schools want to track their rate of retention and learn the reasons why some families may decide not to return the following school year. This is where an Intent to Enroll form can provide good data points to help schools come up with solutions for improved retention. Click to jump to: Intent to Enroll Workflow Best Practices for Not Enrolling Follow-Up Questions Automated Reminders &amp; Emails Adding Intent to Enroll as a Filter Option Creating Searches/Reports on Intent to Enroll How-To: Create &amp; Use an Intent to Enroll Form Sample Form If you'd like to implement this form into your enrollment process, please reach out to our best-in-class Support Team and they'd be happy to set this up for you. Please let the team know what questions and responses you'd like to include on the form, using the examples in this article as a guide. Workflow The Intent to Enroll form is usually displayed on the enrollment checklist of returning students and is filled out prior to the contract. Depending on the response to the \"Intent to Enroll\" question, the contract checklist item and any other enrollment checklist items can be hidden for responses of \"No\" and displayed for responses of \"Yes\" upon form submission. Below is a list of questions we recommend as a best practice. Please note: You can also include any additional questions that fit your school's unique process! Student Name and Enroll Grade : You can have these fields as read-only or display them using merge tokens . Both options will automatically pre-fill the student information. Intent to Enroll: A Boolean (yes/no) field to inquire if the student is enrolling/re-enrolling for the current year. Example question: \"Do you intend to enroll at our school for the upcoming year?\" Not Enrolling/Returning Reason : If the student indicates they're not intending to enroll in / return to your school, you can ask the family to indicate a reason within a single select drop-down menu, so that you can report on these responses within Search &amp; Reports. Example question: \"Please share the main reason you chose not to enroll at our school for the upcoming year.\" Example answer choices: See the section below . Best Practices for \"Not Enrolling\" Reasons When asking families why they're not returning or enrolling at your school, we recommend as a best practice to include a \"prefer not to say\" option to respect a family's privacy in providing more information. If you'd like to learn more information for relocation, change of schools, etc., you can include additional questions that are marked as optional for those families that are willing to provide more detail. See below for an example of reasons you may want to consider. Automated Notifications If you would like to receive an internal reminder or email for anyone that says they won't be enrolling/returning, you can set up an automated communication plan . The criteria would be: Trigger: Enrollment in Progress status IMPORTANT: This plan must be set up prior to any of your students becoming an Enrollment in Progress status for the current year. If it's set up after they're already in Enrollment in Progress, the email will not send. Additional Criteria: Intent to Enroll is \"No.\" Action: There are two options for actions, depending on what setup you prefer: You can set up a Reminder if you want to set a to-do item for yourself or a colleague (e.g. to reach out to the family for an exit interview). You can set up an Email to send to yourself or colleagues with additional information. You'll need to create a custom email template with any merge fields you'd like to display and then select it in the communication plan setup. Date/Time: Immediately. How-To: Search/Report on Intent to Enroll Fields Filter Options If you'd like the \"Intent to Enroll\" Boolean (yes/no) field set as a filter option, reach out to the Support Team so they can add it to your site. Search &amp; Reports Once you've collected the Intent to Enroll form responses from all of your families, you can build a few different reporting views to get more out of this information. Set the Search Criteria Enrollment Status is currently Enrollment in Progress AND All other field s &gt; Intent to Enroll &gt; No Set the Results Display (Within Change/Display Columns) Grouped Report: Select the \"Not Enrolling Reason\" field. This results display is a total count of each reason that families aren't returning to your school, while still displaying the names of each student and any other fields selected to be displayed. If you have any \"other/please explain\" fields that are text boxes, you can select them in the displayed columns list so that you can view any additional information provided. Summary Report: This is where you can compare the intent to roll (yes/no) field or the not enrolling reason to any other field such as grade level, gender, etc. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Enrollment Checklist Fields Overview Forms Settings",

    "body": "Did you know? Did you know that you can create and edit your own fields? Check out this article to learn more: Creating and Editing Fields. This article will outline the requirements and best practices for submitting form edit and/or form build requests through Support. The purpose of this article is to provide you with the information to make the process as smooth and quick as possible. Form Edit Requests When submitting form edit requests, please include as many details as you can. This will help us have a clearer understanding of what needs to be updated. Some items to include in your request(s) are: Name of the form that needs to be edited. The page number(s) that the edits need to be made on. The name of the section or paragraph. The name of the field that needs to be edited (if applicable). What is currently on the form and what you want it to be updated to (if applicable). If adding to the form: What do you want to add (a question, text, section header, etc.)? Where do you want it to be added? What is the exact text/prompt that you want added? If adding a field: What type of field do you want added (dropdown menu, multi-select checkboxes, yes/no field, etc.)? If the field is going to have options to choose from, please send those over exactly as you want them displayed on the form and separated by semicolons. Is the field required or optional? Should it display for all students or select students (do you need to show or hide this field)? If select students, who? Additional notes/comments. Form Edit Requests Tips &amp; Best Practices When submitting form edit requests please keep the following in mind: Screenshots are super helpful! All requests must be submitted in writing (via email or through chat). The average timeframe for edits is 14 business days, but could be extended during Admissions and Enrollment season. Providing as many details as possible will help us get your edits completed on time. List your edits in order from the beginning to the end of the form. Send the exact text that you want to be included on the form, whether in the prompt of a question, the values in a field, or the verbiage listed on the form. This will reduce the need for additional edits. Please highlight, underline, bold or differentiate all edits that need to be made. Form Build Requests When submitting form build requests, please include as many details as possible. This will help us have a clearer understanding of what needs to be created. Some items to include in your request(s) are: The name of the form The type of form you would like created (custom admissions, custom enrollment, custom appointment, recommendation, or a document request form) The term you would like the form to be added to A visual representation of the form you are needing built (example: send an attachment of the paper version of the form you need built), if applicable Note: Please try to send the paper version as a Google Doc, Word Doc, or any editable format (PDFs are not editable and do not allow us to easily copy and paste the text, which can result in delays) List &amp; include all of the pages, section header(s), subsection header(s), verbiage, questions &amp; fields in the order you want them to appear on the form. Specify page names (if applicable) Specify field types (dropdown, yes/no, multi-select, signature, etc.) Provide the exact values/options you want to include in the dropdown or multi-select fields Separate each option by a semi-colon (example: Yes, my child may attend the field trip; No, my child may not attend the field trip; Please contact me) If certain questions should only show for certain students, please specify the question(s) and who it should be visible to (e.g. if the question should only show for upper school students, please specify that in your request) Whether the question is required or optional Any additional notes/comments Form Build Requests Tips &amp; Best Practices When submitting form build requests, please keep the following in mind: Visual representations are super helpful if you have them - even better if it is editable or allows the text to be copied. All requests must be submitted in writing (via email or through chat). The average timeframe for builds is up to 14 business days but could be extended during Admissions and Enrollment season. Be as detailed as possible. List your requests in order from the beginning to the end of the form. Send the exact text that you want to be included on the form, whether in the prompt of a question, the values in a field, or the verbiage listed on the form. This will reduce the need for additional edits.",

    "body": "Overview Online Forms are a great way to collect information electronically so that you can later search and report on it, or use it to drive checklist items, contract fees, or customized text. Online Forms can be added to the checklist so that your applying/enrolling families can fill them out from the Parent Portal. How-To: Understand the Parent Experience with Online Forms Once you have connected an online form to a checklist item (and made it visible to / completable by parents), your applying or enrolling families can see and complete the form from their student's checklist in the Parent Portal. Please note: Although you can use Online Form checklist items in the Inquiry process, these will be internal-only for your team, since Inquiries do not have parent-facing checklists. Online Form checklist items will appear with a 'Complete Form' button next to the title. Parents/Students will click on this button to begin filling out the form. The parent/student experience with the form is similar to what you may have seen in the form preview on the admin side. Fields will appear with the prompts configured on the form setup, and the parent/student can fill them out (with the exception of any fields set to read-only). Fields that have previously been filled out for the student will pre-populate on the form. How-To: Online Form Navigation &amp; Actions At any point, if the parent/student needs to save their progress and return to the form later, they can click the 'Save &amp; Finish Later' button. If a form has multiple pages, there will be buttons for 'Next' and 'Previous' . Parents/Students will also see a page progress bar at the top of the screen, next to the page name. This will show how many pages are left to complete, and also allows the parent/student to easily navigate back to previously completed pages by clicking the dark grey dots. When the parent/student reaches the last page of the form, they will see the 'Submit' button. When clicked, the submit button will complete the form and associated checklist item, and redirect the parent/student back to the checklist in the Parent Portal. Once an online form is submitted, your internal users can view it in the student's contact record on the checklist (by clicking 'View Form') and within Form &amp; Document Submission History (by clicking the form name). You can also generate a printable PDF of the submitted online form at this time. Note on Publishing Changes to Parent-Facing Online Forms If you make and publish any changes on the admin side to an online form, and a student has not yet submitted theirs, the next time they open the online form from their checklist they will see a message at the top that additional requirements have been added since they started filling it out and to review their answers. Please note: Publishing changes to an online form will not affect submitted online forms. If you need families to fill out a new version, you will need to un-submit their form first by unchecking it from their contact record. They will then be able to go back into the student checklist in the Parent Portal and complete the form again.

    "body": "Overview When making electronic check/ACH/PAD payments within the Application Form, Enrollment Contract, or within the Billing Management tab, parents/payers have a workflow of steps to follow so they can connect their bank account for either a one time, manual, or automated ACH/PAD withdrawals. Note about ACH payment: Please note ACH/PAD payments may take 5-7 days to process. Payment Workflows There are 3 different payment workflows depending on your location and payment processor as explained below. Please note the differences, and if you would like to complete the complimentary migration from Stripe Legacy to Payments, please reach out to the Support team. Payments Schools in the US Payments Schools in Canada Stripe Legacy Schools - US &amp; Canada Payments - US The verification process is automatic for families that choose a direct log-in (SSO) and for those that prefer to manually enter their banking details. Workflows Option 1: Logging in directly allows your parents/payers to make an immediate payment. They can click on the 'Agree' button to proceed. Next, they'll be asked to type and select their bank. Option 2: If the parent/payer is unable to find their bank, they can choose to manually add their account as noted by the arrow in the screenshot above. Next, they'll be able to enter these details. IMPORTANT NOTE: there are no micro-deposits if your schools is using Payments. Payments - Canada (PADS) For ACH/PADS in Canada, parents need to manually enter their banking information and will be verified automatically without having to enter micro-deposits. Please note, there is no direct log-in option currently for Payments schools in Canada. Workflow Manual Entry: When parents choose to connect their bank account or pay through Pre-Authorized Debits they will be asked to enter their banking information. Next they will see a confirmation screen. Stripe Legacy - US and Canada For schools that are still on Stripe Legacy and that haven't completed their complimentary migration to Payments (contact Support to make the change), parents/payers can choose a direct log-in (SSO) process with their bank, which will automatically verify the parent/payer without having to enter micro-deposits. However, if a parent/payer chooses to manually enter their banking information, then they will be required to confirm 2 micro deposits to verify their account. Workflows Option 1: Logging in directly allows your parents/payers to make an immediate payment. They can click on the 'Agree' button to proceed. Next, they'll be asked to type and select their bank. Option 2 : If the parent/payer is unable to find their bank, they can choose to manually add their account as noted by the arrow in the screenshot above. Next, they'll be able to enter these details. This initiates the microdeposit process. Families that prefer to enter their banking information in manually when making ACH payments will be required to verify two micro-deposit amounts deposited within 1-3 business days to their bank. Click here to learn about the micro-deposit process. The steps for this are also outlined on the Parent Portal Help Site . To remove the micro deposit workflow and allow parents to connect immediately when manually entering, switch to Payments today. IMPORTANT DISCLAIMER: If your school has NOT migrated to Payments yet, please click on 'Contact Support' in the upper right of your site, or email the team at enrollmentsupport@finalsite.com . This is a free migration and one we strongly recommend making.

    "body": "Overview Parents may submit an inquiry before applying to your school, or they may jump straight to the application without ever inquiring first. In either case, the process for starting an application and submitting it with payment will be the same. In this article, we'll introduce you to what the parent sees when completing an application form in the Parent Portal. The currently published version of your Application Form will always be shown to parents. If you make edits to your Application on the admin side and publish it while parents are in the process of completing it, they will be prompted with a message: \"Additional requirements have been added to this form since you began filling it out. Please review your answers to make sure they are up to date.\" Best Practices for Application Forms When crafting the application form, you want to make sure it's clear what information you're trying to gather. Below are some best practices that we recommend: Be streamlined about the questions you're asking on each page and organize it accordingly. It helps to use section and subsection headers in order to break up the questions (e.g. 'Student Information', 'Previous School History'). Avoid any longer \"to-do\" items, such as medical history, that would take the parent away from the form to gather the information you're requesting. These items should be included as part of the checklist, because if the parent leaves the form, they may not finish filling it out until they complete other steps that you asked of them. For example, if you ask about medical history and you want the parent/guardian to send in forms, make this a checklist item with a file upload. Make sure all required fields are set. How-To: Start an Application Form as a Parent To complete the application process, the parent must have a Parent Portal Account. Once they have created their account and logged in, they'll be able to start a new application. The steps to do so will be slightly different depending on if this is the first application they are completing or if they have already submitted an application for a sibling. -- For New Families If the parent has not completed any applications yet, they will see a 'You haven't added any students yet' message underneath the Students section of the Parent Portal. To start a new application, they can click the green 'Begin admissions process' button in this section. Note: The 'Parent admissions application enabled' checkbox must be enabled within Settings - Portal - Parent Portal Content , or parents will not see the option to start a new application. -- For Families Already in the Admissions/Enrollment Process If the parent has already completed an application for another student, or if they have as student in the enrollment process, they will see a list of their already in-workflow students within the Students section of the Parent Portal. Below this list of students, they'll see the options to 'Add a new student' or 'Apply for a new year'. Both of these links will allow them to fill out a new application. If the parent has previously submitted an application for another student, all fields mapped to PARENT1-4 and/or HOUSEHOLD1-2 entities will be pre-populated on the new application. This saves the parent time so they don't have to retype the same information again. A message will appear at the top of the first page of the application indicating that parent and household information has been pre-filled from a previously submitted application. If the parent prefers not to have this information pre-filled, they can click the 'Click here to clear the form' link to blank out all of the information. How-To: Complete an Application Form as a Parent Once the parent has started a new application for a student, they can proceed through the pages and fill out the information you have requested. Fields marked as required will be indicated with a red asterisk (*). Required fields must be filled out before the parent can proceed to the next page of the application (if they try to click Next without filling out required fields, an error will appear at the top of the screen, listing the fields they need to complete before proceeding). Just like the Inquiry Form, the Application Form is dynamic. Field dependencies can be set up so that targeted questions can populate based on other selections the parent has made in the form. For example, in our best practice application form, answering 'Yes' to the question 'Is there a second parent in this household?' makes the set of fields pertaining to the secondary parent appear. -- Application Form Navigation Parents can navigate through the pages of the application using the 'Next' and 'Previous' buttons in the bottom right of the page. At any point, if the parent/student needs to save their progress and return to the form later, they can click the 'Save &amp; Finish Later' button. Parents will also see a page progress bar at the top of the screen, next to the page name. This will show how many pages are left to complete, and also allows the parent to easily navigate back to previously completed pages by clicking the dark grey dots. -- Review Page Once the parent has filled out the rest of the application, they will reach the Review Page. This page provides the parent an opportunity to review all of the information they entered on the Application Form. It also asks the parent to identify who is completing the application form from a drop-down menu that contains the student and all parents. Please note that the 'Who is completing' field is hard-coded and cannot be removed from the Application Form. However, you will not see this field from the Admin side if you fill out an application form from the Quick Action menu . -- Payment Page If you collect an application fee and it has not been waived for the student, the last page of the application will be the Payment Page. If you have a payment processor integrated with your Finalsite Enrollment instance, parents can choose to pay through a credit card or electronic check. When they do so, the Application Fee checklist item will automatically be marked as complete. Otherwise, you may choose to have parents pay by a paper check or a custom option (e.g. Cash or Wire Transfer). Within the Parent Portal Content setup page , you can customize the instructions for these payment methods, so that parents know where to send their payment or any additional steps to take. It is also a good idea to include these instructions on the checklist item explanation for the Application Fee. For paper check or custom payment options, someone on your internal team will need to confirm that you've received the check and mark the Application Fee checklist item as complete for the parent from your side (on the student's contact record ). Post-Submission of Application Workflow for Parents Thank You Page The Thank You Page is what parents see after they complete the Application Form. It's important that you make the instructions here short and clear. A best practice for this page is to direct parents back to the checklist so they know that once the application form is filled out, they still have steps to take in order to complete the application process. You can edit the text on this page from within Settings - Portal - Parent Portal Content - Application Thank You . Click here for more information. -- Application Thank You Email If you have enabled the Application Thank You Email from within Settings - Communication - Communication Setup , the primary parent will automatically receive an email upon submission of the Application Form. You can edit the text of this email from within Settings - Communication - Email Templates - System Emails - Application Thank You Email . Click here for more information. -- Completing Additional Checklist Items Once the new application form has been imported from the Forms Inbox on the admin side, the parent will be able to see the rest of the checklist items for their student in the Parent Portal. If your school has the Auto-Import and/or Auto-Merge options enabled within Settings - General - Basic Setup , the application form may be imported right away. However, if there is a delay and the application form stays in the Forms Inbox, parents will see a message in the Parent Portal that the checklist is still being built for the student and to check back later. Note: The 'Parent admissions workflow enabled' checkbox must be enabled within Settings - Portal - Parent Portal Content , or parents will not be able to access the rest of their admissions checklist items.

You'll work closely with our Client Enablement Consultant, Courtney Single, to discuss and align on your school's objectives and challenges. Each purchase includes a complimentary site review, offering best practice recommendations for streamlining workflows and maximizing features that may be under-utilized or not yet adopted. Our interactive sessions ensure real-time feedback and troubleshooting, empowering your school to implement changes confidently and effectively. Duration Session duration is most often scheduled in 1 hour blocks for optimal retention and application of concepts learned. Micro-learning is highly effective and can alleviate the feeling of overwhelm that may happen with a 6-7 hour day of in-person training. Different learning styles and durations are important to consider when choosing your preferred learning path. Scheduling Please reach out to courtney.single@finalsite.com for more information on the hourly cost for individualized training for your school. Sessions can be scheduled for different teams or individuals, based upon everyone\u2019s needs and roles. There\u2019s no limit on the number of staff members that can join each session, and each session will be recorded so that you can rewatch the content at your own pace to follow along, or send it to any team members that were unable to attend. On-Site Training Overview Admissions staff often struggle to find time for extended meetings to assess their processes and explore ways to streamline and personalize workflows. While web-based training efficiently covers targeted topics, distractions like phone calls and interruptions can hinder full engagement. Additionally, hands-on learning may be limited without the proper setup. In-person training minimizes these distractions, enabling your school to evaluate processes collaboratively, brainstorm ideas, and engage more actively through hands-on instruction. Another advantage is the personalized guidance from a Client Enablement Consultant, who assists you and/or your team in making informed decisions about workflow improvements. You\u2019ll leave the training with enhanced confidence in navigating your site with a fresh perspective, strengthened team cohesion, and enthusiasm to apply all of the new things you learned. Duration You can schedule a one or two-day training session to cover all of Admissions and Enrollment (not including Billing). Scheduling Please reach out to courtney.single@finalsite.com for more information on the costs for on-site training at your school. There\u2019s a flat fee for travel and accommodations and a daily rate for each training day. Sessions can be scheduled for different teams or individuals throughout the day, based upon everyone\u2019s needs and roles. Please note, there\u2019s no limit on the number of staff members that can join each session, however, each attendee should have their own computer for hands-on learning.",

    "body": "Overview This article will detail the online recommendation experience from the perspective of the parent or student sending a request from the Finalsite Enrollment Parent Portal. Click here for more articles on Online Teacher Recommendations. How-To: Send Recommendation Requests from the Parent Portal To allow families to send recommendation requests from the Parent Portal, you must first have an online recommendation form set up and linked to a checklist item. When a parent logs in to the Portal and clicks into the checklist for one of their students, they will see any recommendation forms listed with a blue Send Request button next to them. The parent explanation for the checklist item will also display directly below it if you want to provide further instructions to families here. Clicking the Send Request button will show a window where the parent can type in the name and email of the person they want to complete the request. This window will also list the name and apply grade of the student for whom the request is being sent. After clicking the blue Send button, a confirmation message will appear at the top of the page indicating that the request has been successfully sent and that an email will be sent to the parent once the recommendation is completed. Please note: This email will be sent to the email address associated with the Parent Portal Account that the parent is logged into when they send the request. As soon as the teacher submits the recommendation form, the associated checklist item will be marked as complete (with date of submission) on the parent and admin side checklist. How-To: Edit or Resend Recommendation Requests Once the parent has sent the initial recommendation request, they will have some additional options and information on the recommendation checklist item: Parents can click View Details to see the details (i.e. status, teacher name and email, and date sent) of the most recent request sent, as well as any past requests. Status will be one of the following: Sent: Email request has been sent, but teacher has not yet started filling out the recommendation form. In Progress: Teacher has started filling out the recommendation form but has not yet submitted it. Completed: Teacher has submitted the recommendation form. The checklist item will also be checked off in this case. Canceled: Request was withdrawn due to a new request being sent. See section on editing a recommendation request below for details. Declined: Teacher declined to complete the recommendation form. A Decline Reason will be listed underneath the status in this case. Editing a Recommendation Request The Edit Request option can be used to send a request to a different teacher or email address. Please note: Sending a new request will automatically cancel the previously existing request for that recommendation. If you want families to request multiple teacher recommendations, you will need to set up separate online forms and checklist items for each. If the teacher clicks on the link to complete a recommendation that has been canceled, they will be notified that the request has been withdrawn. Once the new request is sent, a confirmation message will appear at the top of the page indicating that the previous request has been canceled and the new one has been successfully sent. An email will be sent to the email address associated when the Parent Portal Account once the recommendation is completed. Resending a Recommendation Request The Resend option can be used to send a follow-up email to the teacher the most recent request was sent to, reminding them to complete the recommendation for the student. This reminder email can be edited from the Email Templates page in Finalsite Enrollment, under the Request Emails heading. Click here to learn more about recommendation-related email templates.

    "body": "Overview During the Enrollment Process, it's important to have key information and links within the 'Enrollment email' and 'Contract Thank You email' so that your parents can enroll their students with ease. This article includes best practices and sample email templates for these customizable system-automated enrollment communications as well as a custom 'Enrollment Checklist Reminder' email that can be sent manually or through an automated communication plan for our Finalsite Enrollment EMS PRO accounts. System Automated Emails Welcome Email (Authentication Emails tab). This email is sent automatically once a parent creates their portal account for the first time. Contract Thank You Email (System Emails tab) This email is sent automatically once the contract is submitted with all required signatures. Please note: Contract thank you emails are only sent automatically if they are enabled within the Communication Setup Page (Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Setup) and if the contract submission is performed by the parent. Bulk contract submissions by an admin or contracts subjected to countersign will not trigger the system Contract Thank You Email. If you are using the countersign or bulk submission feature and would like to learn how to set up an automatic communication plan to trigger a Thank You email post-contract completion, please refer to this article within the How-To Set Up an Automatic Contract Thank You Email section. Deposit Receipt (sent automatically, and not customizable or viewable within the system) This email is sent automatically once the deposit is paid on the contract/registration form and the contract is submitted. Custom Emails (Not sent automatically unless you set up an automated communication plan) Enrollment Email for New &amp; Returning Families (Usually sent manually in bulk) Enrollment Checklist Reminder Email (Great use case for date-based automated communication plans). Click here for more enrollment-based automated communication plan examples. Enrollment Email for New &amp; Returning Families Overview The Enrollment Email is a communication that's manually sent in bulk to both new and returning families after the school has generated and previewed contracts to ensure all contract language, fees, and fee rules are confirmed and correct. Click here to review the process for new and returning student enrollment. This email informs families that their contract/registration form is now available in the Parent Portal, and it provides them with a unique auto-generated link that will authenticate the parent/guardian to their child's enrollment checklist if they're not already authenticated. Authentication is the linkage or access between a parent/guardian/consultant and a child/s checklist or ledger (for those with Finalsite Enrollment Billing) within the Parent Portal. -- Enrollment/Contract Email Best Practices Include your school name in the subject line. Include a custom reply-to email address for the Enrollment/Business Office Brand your email with a school banner, logo, etc. Include school contact information and ensure that it is current. If enrollment contact merge tokens are being used. Make sure you check this information within Settings--General--Contact Information. Include the {{recipient.verification_link}} merge token Include the {{recipient.parent_portal_email}} merge token IMPORTANT: Include a link back to the Parent Portal and Enrollment checklist. If you need to find your unique parent portal link, click on your username in the upper right of your site and select 'Parent Portal.' Include a link to the Parent Help Center for a list of FAQs so parents can get answers to their questions during off hours. -- Sample Enrollment/Contract Email IMPORTANT: The email sample below includes some information that may or may not apply to your process so please make sure you read this section before copying and pasting the template into your site and check all merge tokens in the email preview before you send it. About This Template Authentication Merge Token: The first point includes the verification link merge token or authentication link that will auto-generate a hyperlink to your parent portal with a unique authentication code for that contact. If the contact is already authenticated, they can simply log in using this link. If they're not yet authenticated (if they do not yet have access to their child's checklist), this link will grant them access after they first create an account. Account Creation/Portal Email Display for Existing Accounts: The 2nd point has a business rule that will display instructions for the recipient to create a parent portal account if they did not create one yet. If they do have a parent portal account and email log-in, they will see their parent portal email address displayed instead of being asked to create an account. There are also instructions to contact the school if their email address is incorrect because sometimes parents mistype their email upon account creation and don't realize it. This is a nice reminder for the parent to know what email to use to log in, especially year over year for returning families. If you have a specific contact you'd like them to reach out to for parent portal email updates, this is a great place to include it. Click here to learn how to update a parent portal email address. If they can't log in, they can reset their password on the log-in page. Dual Signature and Deposit Instructions: There are instructions near the bottom of the email that is specific to schools that are utilizing the dual signature feature on their contracts. If you are not using dual signatures, you will not need this information. If you would like to add dual signatures to your contracts, please reach out to the Support team. -- Enrollment/Contract Email for New &amp; Returning Students Dear {{recipient.salutation_preferred_names}}, {{school.long_name}} has moved to using an online enrollment system for the {{school.current_enrollment_year}} school year.

    "body": "Overview The Admissions Checklist is comprised of the items that a parent needs to complete in order for their student to be considered a status of Application Complete, as well as the items that your internal team needs to complete or upload for the student to move into this status. Just like the Inquiry Checklist , the Admissions Checklist is dynamic, which means different items will appear on the checklist based on the rules/criteria set up and what is submitted on the student application. Additional Checklist Features: Custom business rules for checklist items such as setting certain checklist items to only display for international students, boarding students, etc. Custom adhoc admissions forms such as a personal statement form and custom teacher recommendation forms. Internal facing forms such as an Interview Notes form. Checklist items with calendars for scheduling appointments and events. For an overview of Finalsite Enrollment checklists and their core concepts, click here . How-To: Understand Parent &amp; Admin Views of the Checklist Applying families will access the admissions checklist within the Parent Portal after submitting an application form. Internal Admins/Users can access a student's admissions checklist from the summary tab of the contact record . Admissions Checklist: Parent View The Admissions Checklist as seen in the Parent Portal can include detailed descriptions of what each item is and any instructions for what needs to be done in order for that item to be marked as complete. To add these descriptions, update the Parent Explanation within the checklist settings . In the Parent Portal, all required items will be displayed first, and any optional items will be down below under an 'Optional Steps' header. For applying families, checklist items can be marked as complete after a parent or internal admin/user performs certain actions on them. The following types of actions can be completed by a parent on the admissions checklist, based on the specific settings and checklist items you have available: Completing online forms Uploading to file upload checklist items Scheduling appointments (if enabled in the calendar settings ) Sending requests for online recommendation forms or document request forms Marking basic items as complete (if enabled in the checklist settings ) Paying ad-hoc fees , application fees, or deposits (for schools with an integrated payment processor) You may also choose to have any of these items as internal-only or able to be completed by your team only. The admissions checklist setup and rules can be customized to meet the needs of your school's unique process. Read on below for more information on the internal view of the admissions checklist. Click here to learn more about the parent experience in the Parent Portal. Admissions Checklist: Admin View The Admissions Checklist as seen internally on the student's contact record does not include detailed descriptions for each item like the Parent Portal checklist. However, you will still see a list of Required items at the top, and any Internal &amp; Optional items below those. Did you know? You can use Granular Permissions to hide checklist data based on the permission level of the individual user. Adding these permissions allows you to control who can see/edit/view the item and the data related to the item. To learn more about Granular Permissions, please refer to our Granular Permissions for Email and Checklists article. The following types of actions can be completed by your internal team on a student's admissions checklist, based on the specific settings and checklist items you have available: Completing online forms Uploading to file upload checklist items Scheduling appointments Sending requests for online recommendations or document request forms Marking basic items as complete (e.g. \"Received Transcripts\") Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Checklist Overview Checklist Settings Checklist Item Types",

    "body": "Overview In this article, you'll learn about the various steps you and your new or returning enrolling families will take in the enrollment process. First, you should make sure that you've completed the following steps: Performed rollover for Returning Students: Click here to learn how . Moved Accepted Applicants (New Students) into Enrollment: Click here to learn how . Click to jump to: Step 1 - Updating Enrollment Statuses Step 2 - Adding Financial Aid Step 3 - Preview Aid/Scholarship Amounts in Bulk Step 4 - Contract Preview &amp; Generation Step 5 - Send Enrollment Email to Parents Step 6 - Monitor Checklist &amp; Contract Completion How-To: Step 1 - Update Enrollment Statuses If you need to place any students in an inactive status for the current year after you've rolled over all returning students, you can update their status in bulk from the Students in Enrollment list page by selecting the desired students, then going to the green Edit menu in the upper right - Change Status. You can also change statuses individually within the Edit menu of the student record. Some of these statuses are listed below, but keep in mind your school may also have custom statuses set up that you'll want to move students into. Click here for an overview of the standard statuses and roles in Finalsite Enrollment. Academic Hold: Used for a student who is on hold for academic reasons. Depending on the process at your school, they can enroll once those grade requirements have been met. Financial Hold: Used for a student who is on hold for financial reasons. Depending on the process at your school, they can enroll once those grade requirements have been met. Mid-Year Withdrawal: The status Mid-Year Withdrawal is used to differentiate the time frame of when students withdraw. If a student is moved to this status, they will be removed from the Enrolled Students page; however, they will remain on the Students in Enrollment List Page. Upon moving a student into mid-year withdrawal, the role of 'Former Student' will be set for them. If you have a student that left the school prior to the end of the year, you can mark them as mid-year withdrawal and then roll them over if needed. Not Enrolling: Used for students who determined during the enrollment process that they are no longer enrolling. Moving a student to this status will automatically apply the 'Former Student' role to them. The rest of your Returning students will be in the Enrollment in Progress status after rollover, with the enrollment type of 'Returning' and a contract status of 'Pending' . These students will show up in the Students in Enrollment list page within the Enrollment tab. Make sure you are viewing the correct term using the picker at the top of the page. Step 2 - Adding Financial Aid In most cases, Financial Aid should be assigned to families before sending out Contracts. If you can assign aid before sending out contracts, you should do that as a next step. Learn about adding Financial Aid to students in the Financial Aid Management article. If you need to send out Financial Aid later in the year (after your enrollment period), we have a couple of suggestions for alternate workflows in this article: Tuition Assistance / Financial Aid Step 3 - Preview Aid/Scholarship Amounts in Bulk Next, you may want to check any financial aid and scholarship amounts for enrolling students, before their contracts are generated and become available in the Parent Portal. You can view this information within a student's contact record (typically under the Enrollment tab ). You can also view it in bulk from an Enrollment list page - first, use the filter options to filter the list down to your Enrollment in Progress students that have a Contract in the 'Pending' status. Then, click on the View in Search button to open this list of students in Search &amp; Reports. Once your results open in Search &amp; Reports, you\u2019ll click on the blue Change Display/Columns button in the upper right. Most often, you can find aid- and scholarship-related fields under the Tuition Assistance or Tuition &amp; Fees grouping, but you can always reference your Fields Setup page to double-check which field groupings you are using. Once you find the grouping in the Fields to Display list, click the plus sign to expand and then check off any columns of data that you'd like to view (such as Financial Aid Amount or Scholarship Amount). You will then click the blue Apply button to add these columns to your report. You can now view any aid or scholarship amounts for your students and ensure they all look correct. You may also choose to save or export your search . Step 4 - Contract Preview &amp; Generation You can preview the contract for any student to check all tuition and fee amounts, dual signatures that are rule-based, contract language, etc. to ensure everything is correct. This can be done before generating the contract. To preview a student's contract, go to their contact record , click on the Manage Contract menu in the upper right, and select Preview Contract. This will allow you to click through a full preview of the student's contract, as it would appear to the family in the Parent Portal. Click here to learn more about previewing contracts. After reviewing and ensuring that the student contracts look correct, you are ready to generate them. Contracts can be generated individually from the student's contact record within the Manage Contract menu . They can also be generated in bulk from the Students in Enrollment list page (within the 'Enrollment' tab at the top of the page). Once a contract is generated for a student, it will be visible to any financially responsible parents/guardians in the Parent Portal, as long as parent enrollment is enabled . Click here to learn more about generating contracts. Step 5 - Send Enrollment Email to Parents Once contracts have been generated, you want to notify families that the contract is available to be filled out and also make sure parents/guardians can get authenticated to access the student contract within the Parent Portal. To prepare to send this enrollment email, you can start on the Students in Enrollment list page (within the 'Enrollment' tab at the top of the page). Click on Filter Options and check off Generated for the Contract Status. You can also apply additional filters such as New or Returning, depending on your process. Once all of your criteria have been selected, click Apply Filter to narrow your results. In the list of students, click the checkbox next to the Name header to select all the students on the page. Please note: This action selects all students on the current page . If you have multiple pages of results, you'll need to repeat this step for each page. Once you have the students selected, click on the green Communicate menu - Send Email . In the Send Email window that appears, select your desired email recipients. You can also choose to send it as a family-based email or schedule it to send at a later date/time. Click here for more information on sending emails. On the template editor page, select your pre-created Enrollment Email Template from the 'Insert Template' drop-down menu. If you don't have an enrollment email template created yet, go to Settings - Communication - Email Templates to get one set up, or our Support team can add our standard enrollment email to your site. This email should give families instructions on how to log into the Parent Portal or create an account if they haven\u2019t already done so. It will also give them their unique authentication code to link to their student(s). Click here for more information on authentication codes. A few key merge fields you should include in your enrollment email that are found within the school and recipient categories are the following: Portal Name: {{school.portal_name}} Portal Web Address: {{school.parent_portal_url}} Authentication Link: {{recipient.verification_link}} - Please note: This merge field does not work well when created as a hyperlinked merge token. It's best to use the merge token as-is. In the preview, it will not look like a clickable link, but in the received email it will be clickable by the recipient. Authentication Code (for manual authentication): {{recipient.authentication_code}} In addition, if you're using dual signatures on your contract, it's best practice to inform families that two unique Parent Portal Accounts (i.e. two unique email addresses) are required for them to complete the contract. Below is an example of an enrollment email. Feel free to copy and paste it into your Finalsite Enrollment site - just be sure to try it out on some test students before setting it live to real families. You may also choose to customize it further with your school's logo, header, or other information. Dear {{recipient.salutation_preferred_names}}, {{school.long_name}} has opened the online enrollment system for the {{school.current_enrollment_year}} school year. To begin this process: 1. Click on the following link to visit your family's enrollment portal: {{recipient.verification_link}} 2. {%if recipient.portal_email != blank%}Log in using your Parent Portal Account email: {{recipient.portal_email}}{%else%}Create a Parent Portal Account by clicking the blue 'Create an Account' button in the right sidebar of the Parent Portal login page.{%endif%} 3. Once you log in or create your account, you will be able to select 'Continue Enrollment Process' to begin the enrollment process. 4. Please complete the online contract and submit your deposit payment. IMPORTANT: For dual household families that are prompted to invite a second signer, both parties MUST have their own unique Parent Portal Account to sign the contract. You will not be able to proceed in the process if you use the same email address to log into the Parent Portal. If you have any issues with the above link, you can authenticate manually using your authentication code: {{recipient.authentication_code}}. Questions about using the Parent Portal? Check out our Help Center. We look forward to seeing you in the upcoming year! Sincerely, {{school.long_name}} After selecting your desired template and making any changes needed, click on the blue Next button, and in the next step, you can preview the emails before they go out. You should check that all of your merge fields are populating as expected with the correct information. Once everything looks good, click Submit and the emails will be sent out. Step 6 - Monitor Checklist &amp; Contract Completion Once you\u2019ve contacted families to let them know their contracts and any other enrollment checklist items are available, you can then monitor the completion status of these items from the admin portal. One way to do this is to use the checklist progress bar within the Enrollment tab \u2013 Students in Enrollment sub-tab. This progress bar will be displayed in the Checklist column on the page, and you can hover over it for any student to see which checklist items they've completed and which are still pending. You can also use the Filter Options on this page to search for specific items based on their completion status. One example using your filter options is to look for a complete checklist item of Contract/Registration Form and an incomplete checklist item of Deposit/Registration Fee . This way you can send a bulk communication to those families to remind them that payment needs to be submitted by a certain date.

    "body": "Overview The Enrollment Checklist works in the same way as your Admissions Checklist , with the addition of two specialized types of checklist items to manage (i.e. the Contract and Deposit). All visibility options and business rules can still be applied to your Enrollment Checklist. In addition, you can set a checklist item to display based on Enrollment Type (i.e. whether a student is New or Returning). Click here to learn more about creating and managing checklist items. Did you know? You can use Granular Permissions to hide checklist data based on the permission level of the individual user. Adding these permissions allows you to control who can see/edit/view the item and the data related to the item. To learn more about Granular Permissions, please refer to our Granular Permissions for Email and Checklists article. How-To: Access the Enrollment Checklist Once students are moved into Enrollment, their enrollment checklist will be visible in the Parent Portal, along with a message that the student is enrolling for \"X\" grade in \"Y\" term. There will also be a quick view of the student's checklist completion status in the progress bar along the right. Parents/Guardians can click on the blue Continue Enrollment Process button or on the View Checklist hyperlink to access their student's checklist. Please note: The Parent Portal Account must be authenticated to the student in order to view the checklist - click here to learn more. Once the parent/guardian has clicked into the checklist, they will see the list of all required and optional items. Completed items will be greyed out with a green checkmark next to them. Pro Tip: Display any important information at the top of the page by customizing the contact communication area . Once all Required checklist items have been marked complete, the child will automatically move into a status of ' Enrolled ', and the Continue Enrollment Process button will be replaced by a \"Thank you! Your enrollment process is complete\" message. The student checklist can still be viewed by clicking on the View Checklist button. If the student is placed in the Academic Hold or Financial Hold status , the parent/guardian will lose access to their student's checklist, and an \"Account is on hold; please contact us for details\" message will be displayed below the student's name in the Parent Portal. The type of hold (i.e. academic vs. financial) is not specified within the Parent Portal. How-To: Use Enrollment-Specific Checklist Items Intent to Enroll Form An Intent to Enroll Form is a custom online form that allows families to indicate whether they intend to enroll/re-enroll in your school or not. Using an Intent to Enroll Form is optional but can be useful to your workflow. This can be a very simple form that simply asks if the student will be enrolling for the upcoming term, and if not, they can provide a reason for their withdrawal. Additional questions or text can be added as needed. Some schools prefer not to display the Contract, Deposit, and other enrollment checklist items until the family has filled out the Intent to Enroll and indicated that their student will be enrolling for the term. To set up this type of configuration, please contact Support to get the appropriate business rules added to your checklist items. Contract If there are not any specific business rules on the Contract checklist item, it will show up on the student checklist as soon as that student is moved into Enrollment. However, the blue Complete Form button will only display once the contract has been successfully generated by an admin . If a contract is in a status of Pending , then the blue Complete Form button will not appear and the parent/guardian will not be able to fill out the form. Please note: Only parents/guardians and consultants with financial responsibility will be able to complete the Contract in the Parent Portal. If a student is authenticated instead of a parent/guardian, they will not be able to complete the Contract, since students cannot have financial responsibility. Click here for more information. Once the Contract has been signed and submitted: (if enabled within Communication Setup ) The parent/guardian will receive an automated contract thank you email. This template can be edited within Settings - Communication - Email Templates - System Emails . Please note: Contract Thank You emails are only sent automatically if they are enabled within the Communication Setup Page (Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Setup) and if the contract submission is performed by the parent. Bulk contract submissions by an admin or contracts subjected to countersign will not trigger the system Contract Thank You Email. If you are using the countersign or bulk submission feature and would like to learn how to set up an automatic communication plan to trigger a Thank You email post-contract completion, please refer to this article within the How-To Set Up an Automatic Contract Thank You Email section. The contract checklist item will be marked complete. The form submission date will display underneath the checklist item. The parent/guardian can click on the V iew Form link to the right of the contract checklist item within the Parent Portal to view and print a PDF copy of the form. You can also see a quick view of the Contract Status within the Enrollment List Page to see which contracts are pending, generated, in progress, pending payment, pending signature, or submitted. Deposit The Deposit fee is a separate checklist item, so you are able to search on who paid and who still needs to pay. For credit card and e-check options, the checklist item will automatically be marked complete upon submission of payment. However, for paper checks or custom payment options, you will manually mark this item complete from the student's contact record upon receipt of payment. The checklist item description is customizable in your checklist settings. Learn more: Deposit Setup: Learn how to set the deposit amount and payment methods accepted by your school. Deposit &amp; Registration Fees: Learn more about deposit amount types, additive deposits, custom deposit text, and more. To manually mark a Deposit as complete, simply check the box next to the checklist item from within the student's contact record. You will then be prompted to select the Payment Method from the drop-down menu and type in the total Amount Paid . You will see this same dialog box if you click on Edit below the checklist item; however, you will then need to manually mark the checklist item complete. Once you're done entering the information, click Submit . The checklist item will be marked complete and you'll see the amount paid, payment method, and date this information was recorded. If you need to edit this information, click on the text for the amount/payment method or on the date. FACTS For schools integrating with FACTS , there is a special 'FACTS Integration' type checklist item. Within the Parent Portal, this checklist item will display with a blue 'Go to your FACTS Account' button once all contracts have been submitted for the family. This button is the link that will push all tuition and fees over so that parents/guardians can finalize their agreements in FACTS. Click here to learn about FACTS best practices and FAQs. Additional Enrollment Checklist Items In addition to the checklist items mentioned above, you may have any number of other enrollment checklist items, such as medical records, emergency contact forms, or welcome event registrations.

    "body": "Overview This article will detail the online recommendation experience from the perspective of the teacher who receives a recommendation request. Click here for more articles on Online Teacher Recommendations. How-To: Understand the Teacher Workflow Receiving the Recommendation After the applicant has sent the request from their checklist in the Parent Portal, the teacher will receive an email with the subject line of 'Recommendation request for [student name]'. Click here to learn about the different Request Emails and how to edit them. Once the teacher clicks the link to complete the recommendation, they will be redirected to a page with some basic information about the process. This text cannot be customized at this time. Clicking the 'Help' button towards the top right corner will display the contact information for the Admissions contact configured on your Finalsite Enrollment site. Teachers can choose to decline the request from this page by clicking on the red Decline Request button. As a best practice, the decline link should also be included in the initial email so that it is clear to teachers how to proceed. Completing the Recommendation To start filling out the online form, the teacher will click on the Start Recommendation button. This will switch the status of the request in the Parent Portal from 'Sent' to 'In Progress', which is visible to the applying family. As the teacher is completing the form, they have the option to click the S ave &amp; Finish Later button at any point. This will save their progress and automatically email them a link to the form ('Recommendation Saved' email template) so that they can pick up where they left off. After filling out the required information, the teacher must click the Submit button to complete the recommendation. This will change the status of the recommendation to 'Submitted' in the Parent Portal and mark the checklist item as complete. Admins will be able to view and download the form from the student's contact record. Upon submitting the form, the teacher will also be redirected to a confirmation page with a link to download a PDF copy of the completed recommendation. Please note: Teachers can also navigate back to the original link in their email to return to this page and download the PDF at a later time. Note on Cancelled Recommendation Requests In the Parent Portal, parents have the option to edit a recommendation request and send it to a new teacher. When they do so, the previous request is automatically canceled. If a teacher clicks the link to complete a recommendation from their email and the request has been canceled, they will be redirected to a page that lets them know that the request has been withdrawn.

    "body": "Overview If you have forms, such as an enrollment contract, that require a signature from a parent, you can take advantage of the Signature Fields in Finalsite Enrollment to capture an electronic signature. This article will go over what is captured with a signature in Finalsite Enrollment and provide some best practices. To learn about how the Dual Signature functionality works for Contracts, click here . How-To: Use Electronic Signatures Signature Fields in Finalsite Enrollment can be set up to capture the following information, which will be typed in by the person filling out the form: Full Name Email Address Phone Number Any of these items can be hidden by configuring the additional options when setting up a signature field on an online form. For example, if you do not want the person filling out the form to enter their email address, you can hide the email field. By default, Signature Fields will have the name and email address fields displayed. Signature Fields also have customizable agree text with a required checkbox for the person filling out the form to click. The default agree text is: \"I agree to the terms and conditions specified herein.\" The rest of the electronic signature information is captured automatically by the system when the signature field is filled in and the form is submitted. This includes: Email address for the currently logged in portal account for the person filling out the form. Timestamp (including date) for the electronic signature. IP Address for the person filling out the form. When using Signature Fields on your online forms in Finalsite Enrollment, be sure to leave them all as 'Unmapped', so that the information does not auto-populate on future forms with electronic signatures. Click here for more information. Contract-Specific Information We store an audit log of the actions taken by the user when interacting with the Contract . This includes IP address, browser information, and each action taken by the user. When paired with an online payment action, such as a deposit paid by credit card, the process together with the steps above follows the ESIGNS requirements and intends to show that the signer (parent/guardian) demonstrated clear intent (e.g. paying a deposit upon submitting the contract). FAQs &amp; Best Practices Below are some frequently asked questions and use cases that we hear from schools, and how they can be addressed through Finalsite Enrollment functionality. If you need to... Require contract signers to create a unique username and password in order to log in and complete the agreement: This is accomplished through the creation of a Parent Portal Account . Provide a place for signatories to explicitly indicate agreement to be bound by electronic signature: This language should be added by the school as part of their contract text (in a comment field ). Additionally, an additional verification step can be included where the parent agrees to be bound by the electronic signature as desired. Incorporate two modes of identifying the signatories of the agreement, such as typing the name and then clicking \"I accept\": This is a standard component of Signature Fields in Finalsite Enrollment. See the how-to section above for more details. Provide an opportunity to cancel the signature before completion: A parent/guardian can always cancel the signature or not submit the form. Provide a confirmation screen with an opportunity for the signer to download/print the entire signed form: Upon submission of an online form in Finalsite Enrollment, the parent can view or download a PDF copy of the completed form from the student checklist. As long as the student remains in the same term, the parent/guardian can always return to the checklist later to view or download the submitted form. Send an email confirming the signer's execution of the agreement: For the Contract, there is an automatic thank you email that can be sent to the parent/guardian upon submission of the contract. This template can be customized to include any additional information you need to provide. Click here for information on how to enable this automatic email. For other Online Forms, you can set up an Automated Communication Plan . Ensure that the agreement cannot be altered or edited once executed: Once a contract has been submitted, the parent/guardian cannot modify the contract in any way, nor can the school. If a contract needs to be modified post-signing, the system allows for regeneration of the contract , but at that time the previous contract becomes void. However, Online Forms other than the Contract can be unchecked on the checklist by an admin, thus allowing the parent/guardian to make changes to the form before submitting it again.

    "body": "Overview Once decisions have been made on which applicants your school has accepted for the upcoming year, you\u2019ll need to move these students into the Enrollment workflow so that they can complete a contract and any other enrollment checklist items. For any parents that declined the offer to enroll their child, or that simply did not enroll, the appropriate statuses need to be set to differentiate them from those entering enrollment. Your school may also have custom enrollment statuses to further define decline reasons, which can be set through an individual or bulk status change. How-To: Move Accepted Students into Enrollment IMPORTANT: Before you begin the process of moving students into enrollment, make sure to activate your new enrollment year in Finalsite Enrollment. Once all inactive statuses have been set for any families that are not enrolling in your school, you can filter out your Accepted students to move them into Enrollment. To do this, start by clicking into the Admissions tab at the top of the page, and make sure you are on the Applicants sub-tab. Set the current Term using the drop-down menu at the top of the page, then click on the blue Filter Options button and mark the Accepted status checkbox. Additional filters can be set as needed.

    "body": "Overview If you have the Enrollment module and collecting electronic contracts through the Finalsite Enrollment system, you might choose to use our Dual Signature feature. This allows for one parent/guardian to complete and sign the contract, and then invite a second parent/guardian to log in, review the contract terms, and add their signature as well. Dual signature requirements are more common with split families or state laws that may require both financially responsible parties to sign a legal document. Standard contract law states that once the first party signs the document, it can no longer be edited after that point. Dual Signature Workflow Overview Setting Up Dual Signatures on the Contract Understanding the Parent Process Options for Countersigning Contracts How-To: Understand the Dual Signature Workflow The process for dual signatures is that the first parent/guardian logs into the Parent Portal and signs the enrollment contract. Once they have signed, there will be a prompt that allows them to invite another parent/guardian associated with that student or a non-household member to co-sign the document. The co-signer will then receive an email to sign in to an existing Parent Portal Account or create a new one with unique information. Please note: The same email address / account cannot be used for both signers. Two distinct Parent Portal Accounts with different email addresses need to be used for dual signatures. Either party can pay the deposit; however, the deposit can only be paid after both parties sign the contract. The reason for this is that if the first party signs the document and pays the deposit, but the second party rejects the contract, this poses an issue. The parents should be under the impression that the contract is not valid until both signatures have been applied and the deposit has been paid. See the 'Understand the Parent Process' section below for a full walkthrough of the parent experience with dual signature contracts. The contract lifecycle for dual signatures is as follows: Pending - Generated - Pending Signatures - Payment Pending - Submitted. Admins can see who signed the contract when it's in a 'Pending Signatures' or 'Pending Payment' status. This is helpful with dual signatures when the admin wants to see who signed the contract first, so they can follow up with the other parent/guardian. This information is visible on the contact record under the Contract checklist item, and on the enrollment list page by clicking on the Pending Signature or Pending Payment contract status. How-To: Set Up Dual Signatures on the Contract To set up the dual signature feature, you will need to add an Additional Signature field (usually contract_signature_2) to your contract form in addition to the standard Signature field. If you need help, Support can assist in setting up dual signatures on your contract. You may also want to have a Boolean (Yes/No) field on your contract for the second signature to be dependent on. This way, you can set the field to have a default value of 'Yes' on the form, so that dual signature is turned on for all families unless you manually switch it off for a student before generating their contract. IMPORTANT: If you change the value in the dual signature trigger field to 'No' for a student after their contract is generated, you must regenerate the contract so that only one signature field displays. If you would rather default to only requiring a single signature, but have the option to require dual signatures for some students, don't set a default value and instead set the custom dual signature field to 'Yes' manually from a student's contact record. How-To: Understand the Parent Process Parent/Guardian A completes the Contract/Registration Form, making sure to fill out all required fields. Within the Electronic Signature section, Parent/Guardian A signs the document (1) , and is notified that an additional signature is required (2) . Once they sign, they\u2019ll click ' Next ' (3) . Parent/Guardian A is presented with a page to invite another person to co-sign the document. Parent A can select a co-signer by clicking on the ' Send Invite ' button. The second signer will receive an email with instructions to log in (or create an account if they don't have one already) and sign the document. Parent A will also see the date and time they signed the document. Parent/Guardian A will be prompted to confirm sending an invite to the selected co-signer and click the blue Send button to continue. Parent A will see a confirmation message in green at the top of the page letting them know their invite has been sent. If the parent/guardian clicks on the blue View Invite button, they can see the details of who was invited to sign the document. On the View Invite window, they can also click on the blue Resend Invite link to resend the link to the second parent/guardian. Now that Parent A has invited a co-signer, they see the following options listed for the Contract/Registration Form within the Parent Portal checklist: Pending Additional Signatures: This shows that the second signature still needs to be made. View Document: Clicking on this button navigates to the beginning of the document for the co-signer to review the document and sign it. The co-signer cannot make any changes to the document since it was already signed by Parent/Guardian A. Parent/Guardian B then receives the email with instructions to sign the document, similar to the example shown below. Parent/Guardian B then signs into the Parent Portal with their own unique username and password, reviews the document, and signs it. Since the document was previously signed by Parent A, Parent B cannot make any edits to the document - all fields will be read-only. Once both parents/guardians have signed the contract, either parent/guardian can pay the deposit. Within the Parent checklist, each Parent/Guardian will see the following: Pending Deposit (1): This shows the deposit still needs to be paid. Pay Deposit (2): Clicking on this button will navigate to the Deposit page. View Document (3) : Clicking on this button will navigate to the beginning of the Contract/Registration Form. Once either Parent/Guardian pays the Deposit, they\u2019ll submit the Contract/Registration Form and it will now be marked as complete on the checklist as shown below. No changes can be made unless it is regenerated by the school. How-To: Countersign Contracts If you would like to add the signature of a representative from your school, along with the parent/guardian signatures, consider enabling our Contract Countersign feature . This allows you to add an electronic signature or an image of somebody's signature (e.g. your Head of School or Principal) to enrollment contracts after they've been signed by all required parents/guardians.

Expand this dropdown to read about each option in the above screenshot. Name: The display name of the contract fee, which can be edited at any time. Canonical Name: This a unique system identifier for the fee designated by either the system or the user at the time of fee creation. It cannot be edited.

The types of fields that can be associated are: any field with ctype of ScholarshipField, OptionalFeeField, RequiredFeeField; also the \"standard\" fields scholarship_amount and financial_aid_amount. To create a ContractFee for a Field, choose the amount_type \"field\"; the \"amount\" and \"charge_type\" fields will be hidden and a \"field\" selection will become available. Only one ContractFee can be created per Field (for a given SchoolYear). Creating a ContractFee for a Field will automatically create the associated Contract Fee Rule for the Field (with an empty test, i.e. if the Field has a value it will be applied; without a value it will not be applied). Amount: Type the amount of the fee in a numerical value. Explanation: This is the text a parent will see on the contract, explaining what the fee is for. Allow Payer-Specific Overrides?: (Split Contracts) Opting to Allow Payer-Specific Overrides on a contract fee means that you can manually set the amount each financially responsible payer will owe for a fee or is granted for any discount. Setting a fee up to allow Payer-Specific Overrides is only available as an option if you have Split Contracts enabled on your site. (This is only available as part of our Billing Module.) In addition, Deposits and Required fees marked \u2018add to deposit\u2019 cannot be payer-specific at this time. Add to Deposit: Check this box for any required fees that need to be paid with the deposit. The contract will display an itemization of all fees collected as part of the deposit/registration fee payment. (This won't appear as an option if the fee can not be added to the deposit. For example, you won't see it on Tuition fees.) Percent of Some contract fees will include the Percent of edit section. Whenever you have a fee or discount that is set to be collected or calculated as a percentage, the system needs to know what to include when doing the math. Depending on the type of fee, you'll see different percentage options. These may include: Tuition Required Fees Financial Aid Amount (-) Scholarship Amount (-) Tuition Discounts (-) Deposit (-) Contract Fee Rules Like Contract Fees, Contract Fee rules need to be added and edited by our team . If you need one or more added or updated, please connect with us . Contract Fee Rules basically tell a Contract Fee how to work. They look at the field data on student records to determine whether or not the fee applies to them. For example, if you have a Mystery Club fee that only applies to high school students who are in the Mystery Club, we can add a rule to the Mystery Club Fee to tell it to check if the student is in High School and in the Mystery Club before it applied the fee to their contract. We also have a separate article dedicated to these rules. Check that out here: Contract Fee Rules: Overview &amp; Usage . Closer look at Contract Fee Rules Expand this dropdown to read about each header in the above screenshot. Rule Description: This is the name of the rule. It's internal only which means it never shows up on the parent end. Rule: This is the rule that our team writes to tell the fee how the contract fee should apply. Active: If this is checked, the rule is enabled. Last Edit: The last date that an edit has been made to the fee. Edit History: Click this to open a pop-up box showing the edits that have been made, the date they were made on, and the name of the individual who made the change. The box will show the last 5 edits to the rule. Viewing the Edit History To view the edit history of a contract fee, click on the View Changes link in the Edit History column. This will open a pop-up box that displays the log of edits that have been made to the fee or rule. You'll see the name of the person who made the changes, the date the changes were made, and the details of the change. Making Fees Inactive You have the option to inactivate fees that are no longer in use. This is a good practice to keep your Contract Fees page clean and efficient. You can always make the fee active again should you need to use it. How to make a fee inactive To make a fee inactive, select the Make Inactive link on the far right side of the page. You will be asked to confirm within a pop-up box before the action is completed. Where does it go When you deactivate a fee it is no longer visible on the contract fees page without filtering. Use the Filter Options to show all inactive fees. How to activate it again Filter the page to show your inactive fees. Select Make Active on the right side of the page. Select Confirm in the confirmation pop-up box that appears. Additional Resources Office Hours &amp; Past Session Recordings Contract Fee Rules",

    "body": "Overview Continuous enrollment allows families to sign a contract once, with the option to opt-out each year, rather than having them complete and sign a full contract year over year. In the business world, this is often known as an evergreen, perpetual, or auto-renewing contract. To learn how to enable the ability to bulk submit contracts for continuous enrollment, click here. Continuous Enrollment FAQs Can a school do continuous enrollment for some students and a yearly contract for others, or does it have to be one or the other across the board? You can do both. The most common use case for this is new vs returning students. However, you could also have international / day student differences or any other groupings. When can it be enabled? You can enable continuous enrollment at any time. However, you can only bulk-submit contracts after the parents have signed their first-year contract. Continuous Enrollment within Finalsite Enrollment To learn about enabling the \u2018Continuous Enrollment\u2019 feature in Finalsite Enrollment, please click here to navigate to our setup article. Example Continuous Enrollment Workflow Breakdown by Year Year 1 Families sign a contract containing legal language for Continuous Enrollment. The tuition and fees are displayed on the contract. Once the contract is signed, a deposit or registration fee can be collected and the parent can enroll in AutoPay . Year 2 The school bulk submits contracts with the option to rollover the same payment plans or choose new ones. The parent can update AutoPay information , if necessary. Pro tip: Our Rollover for Continuous Enrollment Schools article offers outlines for managing contracts after rollover. For more details and options on workflows, please refer to that article. Tips &amp; Best Practices Engage your legal team. Always talk with your legal team before updating your contract and processes. State laws vary so what works for your school may not work for another. Review your goals and identify areas where your process can be streamlined to reduce work. In other words, you should consider the following: Where do parents get stuck in the process? Are there easier, smaller changes that could eliminate many issues? Click to expand each of the items below and learn more. Separate your contract, Tuition &amp; Fees agreement, and TILA from your other enrollment forms. Registration forms like sports sign-ups and field trip waivers should be independent of your contract. These can be created as custom enrollment forms instead and moved to their own checklist items. Are you asking for information each year that isn\u2019t necessary? Finalsite Enrollment supports a powerful set of dynamic checklist items or dynamic content, forms, and fields so that only the necessary information is collected. Review your contract language history. Are you changing your contract and policies every few years? If so, talk through the implications of a perpetual process and how you will communicate changes to policy and collect consent to new addenda, if needed. How do you handle communication around billing information and Truth in Lending (TILA) if they are separate from the contract? What happens if the parent disputes the tuition and fees because they need to see or approve the amount in future years; for example, if the financial aid amount changes after the renewal deadline date? What policies will you need to update to support new processes? For example, what kind of notice of the renewal period will you provide? Will you notify parents 30 or 60 days in advance of the annual deadline? How will you handle a situation when a parent does not notify you that they do not wish to return? How will you collect and verify notice from parents that they are not returning? What happens in the case of split households?

    "body": "Overview This article will explain how to set up online recommendation forms in Finalsite Enrollment as an admin, as well as some best practices for doing so. Click here for more articles on Online Teacher Recommendations. You can build multiple different teacher recommendations as online forms in Finalsite Enrollment. They can be grade or subject-specific and customized to meet your school's needs. Our Support Team can even help you set up business rules to display different recommendation forms on the checklist, based on the student (e.g. international vs. domestic). How-To: Set Up Online Recommendation Forms General Setup Online Recommendations can be configured from 'Settings' - 'Forms' - 'Teacher Recommendation Forms'. Recommendations are set up in the same way as your other custom online forms in Finalsite Enrollment, but only ones created as Teacher Recommendation Forms will have the unique send functionality. Click here to learn how to create a new form, or click here to learn about editing existing forms. After creating the form, you must link it to a Recommendation Form type checklist item on the admissions checklist, so that students can send requests. Best Practices for Recommendations Keep recommendation forms as short as possible while still collecting the information you need to make admissions decisions. Utilize LikertFields in your recommendation forms to provide an easy way for teachers to rate students on different criteria. Number or label your recommendation forms if you have multiple in order to easily distinguish between them on the student checklist and in building searches. For example, instead of having two forms called 'Teacher Recommendation', you might name them 'Math Teacher Recommendation' and 'English Teacher Recommendation'. Communications Teacher Recommendation forms have a unique set of emails associated with them that send at various parts of the process. The templates for these emails are located under the 'Request Emails' tab on 'Settings' - 'Communication' - 'Email Templates'. You can learn more about each of these templates here . How-To: Admin Checklist View and Management Manage Online Recommendation Forms Admins can submit teacher recommendations and track the status of requests within an applicant's checklist on their contact record . Admin-submitted recommendations will come from the email address that they are using to log into the Finalsite Enrollment system. On the student checklist, you can view the date the request was sent. This will be blank if no requests have been sent yet. Clicking on 'Manage' will allow you to view the details (i.e. status, teacher name and email, and date sent) of the most recent request sent, as well as any past requests. Status will be one of the following: Sent: Email request has been sent, but teacher has not yet started filling out the recommendation form. In Progress: Teacher has started filling out the recommendation form but has not yet submitted it. Completed: Teacher has submitted the recommendation form. The checklist item will also be checked off in this case. Canceled: Request was withdrawn due to a new request being sent. See section on editing a recommendation request below for details. Declined: Teacher declined to complete the recommendation form. Parents can view the Decline Reason by clicking the 'View Details' button next to the recommendation checklist item in the Parent Portal. Please note: Admins will not be able to see the Decline Reason. From the details window, you can also send a reminder email to the teacher for the most recent request, or edit the request to send to a new teacher or email address. Upload Teacher Recommendation Forms If you receive a recommendation from a teacher outside of the Finalsite Enrollment workflow (e.g. emailed a PDF copy, scanned a paper form), you can add this to the student record by clicking the 'Upload' button next to the recommendation checklist item. This will attach the form to the student record, and mark the checklist item as complete. When files are uploaded internally to a Recommendation Form type checklist item, parents will be able to see that the checklist item has been checked off, but they will not see the contents of the uploaded file -- this remains confidential with the school. Parents do not have the upload option on recommendation form checklist items, so if they have an existing recommendation from a teacher that they want to use, they will need to provide it to your Admissions team directly for upload into Finalsite Enrollment. Completed Online Recommendation Forms When a teacher completes their recommendation or when an admin uploads a file, the checklist item will automatically be marked as complete with the date the form was submitted. To see completed teacher recommendation forms, click on View Form . If you need to edit the request, click on Manage. Please note: Information from teacher recommendation forms does not write through to the student's contact record. It can be viewed on the submitted form/PDF, or answers can be exported in bulk using a form export. If you would like to set up a form export for one of your recommendation forms, please contact Support .

    "body": "Overview Each school year, your returning students will need to be rolled over in the system so that they can complete the enrollment process for the new term. This typically takes place after you've completed your annual Enrollment Refresh . A few automatic behaviors take place when using the rollover tool, which will help you manage the next steps in the enrollment process. IMPORTANT: Before you can roll students over, your new enrollment year must be set up and activated from the Enrollment Setup page - click here to learn how. How-To: Prepare for Rollover Before performing the rollover of your returning students, you should make sure to change the status of any students that withdrew in the middle of the school year to Mid Year Withdrawal before performing the rollover. To locate your current students, click on the Enrollment tab - Enrolled Students list page. On this page, make sure you have the current year selected from the Terms picker at the top. Select any students you need to change from the list by checking the box next to their name. Then, click on the green Edit menu in the upper right - Change Status. In the 'Select Status' window that appears, select the Mid Year Withdrawal status, then click the blue Next button to review your changes. Finally, click the blue Save button to confirm the status change(s). Please note: For any students that attended for a full year but are not returning next year, you will still roll them over because you need them to be active for the full current year. Once they have been rolled over, then you can set their status to an inactive one of Not Enrolling . Now you\u2019re ready to perform rollover! How-To: Complete the Rollover Process Students can be rolled over individually, in bulk, all at once, or at different times, depending on what works best for your school and your process. To get started, click on the Enrollment tab at the top of the page. Students can be rolled over from the 'Students in Enrollment' or 'Enrolled Students' list pages. To filter down to specific grades, statuses, or any other custom criteria you have set up, use the blue Filter Options button on this page, set your filters, and then click on Apply Filter . From the list, select the students you want to rollover by checking the boxes next to their names. To select all students on the page, click the checkbox next to the Name column header. Please note: If you have multiple pages of results, you will need to repeat this process for each page. You can set the number of contacts to appear per page from Settings - General - Basic Setup . Once you have all of your students selected, click on the green Edit menu towards the upper right and choose the Rollover to New Term option. The Rollover Students window will appear with some additional information. Be sure to read this carefully so you know what to expect before, during, and after the rollover process. With the rollover action: ONLY students in the status of Enrolled will be rolled over. If you select students in other enrollment statuses (e.g. Enrollment in Progress), they will not be processed, but any Enrolled students you selected in the same batch will roll over as expected. Students will be moved to the next enrollment year as Enrollment in Progress status, with an enrollment type of Returning . They will be promoted to the next grade (unless you have set them to stay in their current grade within Settings - General - Grades ). Graduating students will be marked as Alumni (unless otherwise noted within Settings - General - Grades ). Alumni is an \" Out of Workflow \" role and graduates who are marked as alumni will no longer be visible in a Parent's portal/checklist. Students in the status of Mid Year Withdrawal will be marked as Former Students . Once you click the Proceed with Rollover button, the system lets you know this action cannot be undone and asks you to confirm. Click 'Confirm' to start the rollover action, which can take a few minutes to complete. Please remember to repeat this action for any remaining pages of students. Once the rollover is complete, you will be able to see your students within the Enrollment List Page - Students in Enrollment for the new term. These students will now have a status of Enrollment in Progress , a student type of Returning , and a contract status of Pending . How-To: Post-Rollover Steps to Take After you have completed the rollover, you should: Move any students who are not returning for the current term to the Not Enrolling status. If your school has any custom enrollment statuses set up to define specific reasons for students who aren't returning, you can set those at this time as well. Move any students to the Financial Hold or Academic Hold statuses, as appropriate. Additional Notes about Rollover: For schools without traditional PK-12 grades: If your 'Grades' in the system are actually programs (that students may stay in for multiple years consecutively), you may not have students automatically advance to the next grade upon rollover. You can always manually change student's grades, individually or in bulk, after the rollover process is complete. Term-based fields: All term-based fields - such as deposit, financial aid, scholarship, etc. - will need to be set up for the new enrollment year, so that you can track them for each student. Multiple rollovers: If a student was previously rolled over, the rollover action will ignore a second rollover, which is a safeguard against duplicating this action. Repeated or skipped grades: If a student is repeating a grade or skipping a grade, you can roll them over and then manually update their grade (using the Edit menu option) accordingly. Enrollment type: If a student left your school for a few years and came back, you can modify the enrollment type of that student to either new or returning once they come back to your school.

    "body": "Overview Document Request Forms (aka Checklist Item Request Forms) provide flexibility for schools to electronically receive confidential admissions or enrollment documents directly from other schools or organizations, while also providing visibility for applying or enrolling families to track completion progress. Completed document request forms always remain confidential to the school, and a parent will only see the completion progress -- not the contents -- of the form. -- Some common use cases for Document Request Forms include: Parent-requested documents: Have parents send a request for a student's previous school Transcripts/School Records directly from the admissions checklist. Click here to learn about a process flow for this use case! Internal admin-requested documents: Internally send a request to collect interview notes from your school staff after a student visit, even if the staff member does not have a Finalsite Enrollment account. Benefits of Document Request Forms Remove the middle man: School-confidential documents can be collected from a school or other outside organization and brought directly into Finalsite Enrollment from the source. Time saver for your team: Eliminates the need for receiving hard copy documents that have to be scanned and uploaded into the system. Quicker turnaround on checklist items: Checklist items are marked complete automatically once the requested documents have been uploaded by the request recipient. Families are kept in the loop: Parents/Students can track the completion status of requested items from the Parent Portal, and they receive an automated but customizable email notification once the requested documents have been submitted. Seamless integration with the Online Review Module : Uploaded files can be easily displayed in a student's review packet, without the need for any manual file uploads by the school. More efficient searching and reporting: Easily see when required documents have been received in real-time, instead of having to wait on an admin/user to manually upload the received documents to the system.

    "body": "Overview Before you generate contracts for your new or returning students, a best practice is to preview them to make sure that all contract fees (e.g. tuition, fees, and discounts), custom scholarships, payment plans, and other contract content is populating as expected. In this article, you will learn how to use the contract preview options available on the student's contact record . Before generating contracts, it's critical to do the following in your Finalsite Enrollment site: Review and update (if needed) all tuition and fee amounts . Review all contract fee rules and confirm that tuition and fee amounts are populating as expected for the correct students. If you need to add, edit, or remove any contract fee rules, please contact Support . Review the list of term-based fields , so that you know which fields clear out automatically on a year-over-year basis. Clear out any non-term-based fields that drive tuition and fees in bulk, such as custom scholarship and financial aid fields. Click here to learn how. Identify if you need any required contract fields that are set at the time of contract generation, such as deposit or contract due dates. Confirm that you have enrollment enabled in the Parent Portal when you are ready for the enrollment checklist and contract (once generated) to be accessible by families. You can leave parent enrollment disabled while you preview and update contracts, which means families will not see the enrollment checklist or contract in the Parent Portal. Even if you generate contracts for students, as long as parent enrollment is disabled parents will not be able to view anything in the Parent Portal. How-To: Preview Individual Contracts (Before or After Generation) You can preview a student's contract before or after it is generated. To do this, navigate to the student's contact record , then click into the green 'Manage Contract' menu - ' Preview Contract'. This will take you to a preview version of the student\u2019s full contract, just as the parent would see it in the Parent Portal. It includes all tuition, fee, and discount amounts so you can ensure all amounts are accounted for correctly. You can select options for things like fields and payment plans while in the preview mode for testing purposes - they will not be saved to the student's record. In order to preview tuition amounts through the Preview Contract link, you must click through each page by using the Next button at the bottom. You can not skip ahead using the Select Page dropdown. The amounts will only populate if you click through each page of the contract to get to the tuition page. Make edits to contract fees as needed within your settings or the student's contact record. If any fee rules are not triggering correctly or need an update, contact Support to get them updated. Once everything looks good for all students you want to test, you are ready to generate contracts in bulk . Please note that once contracts are generated successfully (i.e. without errors), they'll become available within the Parent Portal, as long as parent enrollment is enabled . Make sure you preview contracts for multiple students to confirm the different fee rules. For example, let's say that you have a field trip fee that should only apply to 9th graders. Check that it displays for a 9th grader as expected and that it doesn't display for an 8th grader or a 10th grader. Previewing the full contract is a great way to test the following: All contract fees and contract fee rules . Contract language, including custom language driven by liquid logic and any merge tokens . Required contract fields that you set upon contract generation, such as an individualized contract or deposit due date that displays within the contract language as a dynamic merge field. If the dual signature feature is enabled/disabled based on household setup or internal field settings. Any additional customizations to your process. How-To: Preview Tuition &amp; Fee Amounts for Generated Contracts After contracts are generated, there are a few different ways that you can preview just the tuition and fee amounts (not the full contract text) for students. Student Contact Record Once a student's contract has been generated, an additional option of 'Preview Tuition &amp; Fees' will appear within the green 'Manage Contract' menu on their contact record , While the 'Preview Contract' option opens the full contract (as described in the section above ), the 'Preview Tuition &amp; Fees' option gives you a quick view of just the tuition, fees, aid, and payment plans for the student. -- Enrollment List Page Within the Enrollment List Page - Students in Enrollment , you can easily click to preview the tuition and fees for any contract in the Generated state . Follow these steps: First, use the term picker at the top of the page to select the current enrollment Term . Use the blue Filter Options button and select only the contract status of Generated. Once you\u2019ve set your filters, click the blue Apply Filter button. In the Contract Status column on the page, click the word 'Generated' to open a quick-view window containing all tuition and fees for that student. This is the same window you will see if you use the 'Preview Tuition &amp; Fees' option on the student's contact record. Continue down your student list to preview tuition and fee amounts as needed. -- Net Tuition &amp; Fees Report Within the Enrollment List Page - Net Tuition &amp; Fees , you can bulk preview all of the tuition, discounts, fees, aid, and payment plans for your students in enrollment. For any contracts in the 'Generated' status, you can click the word in the Contract Status column to see a quick view of all tuition and fee amounts for that student, just like in the Enrollment List Page example above. If any contracts are in a ' Pending ' status, amounts will not display on the Net Tuition &amp; Fees Report. Amounts only appear here once the contract is generated. Contract fees for pending contracts can be viewed within the 'Manage Contract' menu of the student record - see the section above on previewing individual contracts for more details. Please note: Any optional fees or fees driven by user selections within the contract (e.g. transportation fees) will not show up on this page until the parent completes the contract.

    "body": "Overview With virtual events and meetings taking center stage for schools (and most businesses) this spring, online video platforms like Zoom have become an essential part of reaching and communicating with both your internal team and current and prospective families. connect with students via social media Seeing the same blank, messy (especially thanks to our new officemates, i.e. our kids and dogs), or boring background can get old. One way to up your virtual event game, hide a messy home in the backdrop and make your virtual team meetings more fun is by using custom virtual backgrounds in Zoom. You can display them behind you for your virtual revisit days, coffee chats, panels, internal meetings, and other virtual events. Not only do virtual backgrounds keep things interesting and make calls more fun, but they\u2019re also a great way to showcase your school in a creative\u2014and free\u2014way. And all you\u2019ll need is a Zoom account and a picture of your choice (maybe you have a photo from campus you\u2019d like to use, or you can even build your own for free in Canva) Wondering how to get started? Here\u2019s a step-by-step guide to help you create and set up your custom virtual backgrounds in Zoom . How to Create Your Own Zoom Background You can use any picture you have on-hand, download one from online, or even use a GIF or design of your own creation as a background in Zoom. In order to get the best results and make sure your background will upload and display correctly, you\u2019ll need to follow some basic guidelines. Here are the guidelines you need to follow: Make sure your picture format file is a: GIF, JPG/JPEG, or PNG. Use the recommended dimension of 1920px by 1080px (minimum 960px, and maximum 1920px) (one easy way to get the right dimensions is to use Canva , which has a pre-set template for virtual backgrounds\u2014 here are some templates we created to get you started . You can also create a design to choose your exact design dimensions, upload an image, and scale it perfectly) Ensure your file size is under 5 MB (if it\u2019s not, you can use a tool like Squoosh to reduce your file size) Ready to start creating a virtual background? Get started with our Canva templates. How to Add a Virtual Background Before/During a Zoom Meeting Here are the steps you can follow to set up and start using your virtual background in Zoom. BEFORE a Zoom Webinar or Meeting: 1. Open your Zoom desktop application 2. Click on settings in the top right corner 3. Click Virtual Background 4. Select one of Zoom\u2019s preset backgrounds, or click the \u201c+\u201d button to upload your own. On the Fly DURING Your Webinar or Meeting: 1. Log in to your Zoom account/portal. 2. Start your meeting, or click \u201chost a meeting\u201d in the top right corner. 3. On the bottom of your screen, click the ^ arrow next to Stop Video. 4. Click \u201cChoose a Virtual Background.\u201d 5. Make sure the \u201cI have a green screen\u201d box is checked at the bottom of the screen. 6. Select the picture you want to use(the background is automatically applied). If you haven\u2019t uploaded your image yet, you can click the + button on the right-hand side of the screen and upload one from your computer 7. Return to the meeting (exit out of settings).

For more information on setting up the background for rooms ahead of time, check out Zoom\u2019s guide to setting up backgrounds for different rooms . Ways to Use Custom Backgrounds at Your School Here are a couple of ideas of ways your school can use custom backgrounds: Have each of your panelists, staff members, or teachers select a different shot of campus, or a picture of their classroom to use as a background. Create a custom background with your school colors and logo. Create a background with your social media handle to make it easy to connect with students via social media after the event. Send out custom backgrounds to families with instructions so they can use them when joining an event or revisit day. This would also be great for a group shot. Have students create \u201cschool pride\u201d backgrounds as an activity and have everyone vote on their favorite. Setting up your virtual background will likely only take you a few minutes, but it can have a lasting impact. There are endless ways to use virtual backgrounds for both internal meetings and external virtual events. You can use them to spread information, brighten up meetings, add some fun to your virtual revisit days, and share more about your campus while you operate virtually.

    "body": "Important: Please Read The information in this article is only relevant to schools still using the Legacy version of Stripe. If your school is using Payments, please reference this article instead for the most up-to-date information. If your school would like to set up your complimentary migration to Payments, please contact the Support Team . Passing Fees on to Parents Schools may choose to pass their convenience fees for credit card or electronic check payments to the parent. Convenience fees can be applied to the deposit, application, ad-hoc forms, or billing. They can be in the form of: a flat dollar amount a percentage or a combination of both A fee description, as well as a fee notification message, can also be configured to show on payment screens. Convenience fee types (percentage, flat fee, or combination) and descriptions/notifications can be configured separately for credit cards and electronic checks. Fees passed on to parents can be adjusted under Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payment Setup. Please note that only those designated as System Admin or Admin have access to this page. Read more about the process in our article: Payments: Passing on Convenience Fees to Parents Stripe Legacy Fees at a Glance: Not applicable for schools using Payments. See the note below* Stripe's merchant fees are 2.9% + 30\u00a2 per transaction for credit cards and 75\u00a2 per transaction for ACH . There is an additional 1% charge applied to international credit cards. If your school is using our Billing Module with Stripe Legacy, all ACH fees are refunded at True-Up. *IMPORTANT: If your school is using Payments, this article will not apply to you. Click here for info about Payments. See below for specifics on how convenience fees are applied on both the Finalsite Enrollment and the Stripe side. How-To: Understanding Convenience Fees in Stripe Important This is only relevant to schools using Stripe Legacy. If your school is using our Payment service, this information does not apply to you. The convenience fee paid by the parent in Finalsite Enrollment is not applied directly to the convenience fee for the payment processor (i.e. Stripe). To help demonstrate how the amounts apply and end up in the final payout to the school, we have created an example where the deposit/fee amount paid by the parent is $1,000 with a convenience fee of 2.9%: Breakdown of this example: The deposit amount charged to the parent in Finalsite Enrollment is $1000. As the parent is paying with a credit card, a $29 convenience fee (2.9% of $1000) is added, making the final amount the parent pays in Finalsite Enrollment $1029. When Stripe receives that $1029 payment, their 2.9% convenience fee plus the 30\u00a2 transaction fee is applied to it, for a total of $30.14. After subtracting this $30.14 in fees from the $1029 payment amount received from the parent, the school is left with a payout amount of $998.86. Please note that your payouts will look different depending on the specific amounts parents are being charged in Finalsite Enrollment, but this same structure will apply.

    "body": "Overview With Document Request Forms (aka Checklist Item Request Forms), parents or admins can submit a request to a contact at another school/organization/contact and allow them to upload transcripts, medical records or other relevant documents directly into Finalsite Enrollment. This article will explain how to create a Document Request Form and attach it to your student checklist, so that you can start electronically collecting documents for applying families. How-To: Create a Document Request Form Creating and configuring this new type of form is simple. First, navigate to ' Settings' - 'Forms' - 'Checklist Item Request Forms ' in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Click on the green Add Form button to get started. If you need an overview of creating online forms in Finalsite Enrollment, click here. Once you have created your form, you need to add at least one File Upload type field to the form, in order to allow the request recipient to upload documents. Add a field to the form and select the field type of File Upload Field . All file upload fields support uploading multiple files. You can also select a Checklist Item to Complete Upon Upload in the event that you want the upload of a file to mark another checklist item as complete. This is optional and will only work with File Upload type checklist items. You can also include additional fields on the form if you would like to collect any other information from the recipient of the request. Fields will pre-populate information from the student\u2019s record, so be careful which fields you put on the form, especially those that are not read-only. Like Recommendation Forms, field data collected on the Document Request Form will not write through to the contact in the system, and you will not be able to search on them or pull them in a report later. However, information from those fields can be bulk exported in a Form Export. Please Note: File Upload Fields can only be used on AdHoc Forms (Custom Admissions/Enrollment Forms), Document Request Forms, and Teacher Recommendation Forms. Since files have to be uploaded to an already completed contact, you cannot collect them on the application. Best Practice for Records Release Forms We do not currently have a way for a parent to complete/sign a form and then send that signed form to a previous school requesting records. The best way is to have 2 separate checklist items as follows: Parent signs a release of records form Parent then sends the records request to the previous school. If they require parent consent, the admin can provide them with the pdf version of item #1 with the parents signature. How-To: Configure Checklist for a Document Request Form Once you have at least one Document Request Form published on the site, you can add the associated checklist item to an Admissions or Enrollment checklist. To do this, navigate to 'Settings' - 'Checklists' - 'Checklist Type of your Choice' and click the plus sign in the upper left to Add a new checklist item. Select the Item Type of ' Document Request Form' , and then select the form you just created from the drop-down list below. Please note Even if the checklist item is parent-facing, the submitted form and any documents that the receiver uploads are only visible to the admin, not the parent. If you would like to set further restrictions on who at your school can see the data submitted in the checklist item, you can apply granular-level permissions to it. Granular Permissions are permissions that you can attach to checklist items (and/or email templates) to designate which Admins can/can't interact with them. Read more about this in our article, Granular Permissions for Emails and Checklists . In the checklist item details, you can also select any custom email templates you have created to use for the different stages of the process (i.e. Sent, Reminded, Submitted, and Saved ), or you can just use the System Defaults which you can find and customize under the email templates page: Document Request Completed Document Request Reminder Document Request Saved Document Request Sent Merge Token Note Please don't edit the built-in merge token you see in these emails: {{checklist_request.request_link}} This merge token is specific to the communication and will bring the recipient right to the form itself. This is important because you don't want to accidentally insert a merge token that takes them to the student checklist instead. As with your other checklist items, you can also configure custom criteria to determine which students have this item on their checklist. Click here to learn more. After you have added the form to the checklist, the request can be sent from the admin or parent portal side, just like with recommendation forms.

    "body": "Overview For schools that accept international students, it's best practice to ensure your site is set up for a positive parent experience that shows you value diversity and promote cross-cultural understanding. In addition, it's beneficial to have the same seamless process for reporting and admission/enrollment requirements as you have for domestic students. Let's explore some best practices to consider during and after your implementation so that all families have the same online experience. PRO TIP: As you review this process, you may think of ways to support other groups of students where something is unique to them such as boarding/day, IEP/504, etc. Forms Translation: Weglot : Weglot is a translation software that can be used within your site. It integrates seamlessly into your parent portal and will allow the parents/guardians to translate their view of the portal, checklists, and forms. Please check out our Language Translation with Weglot article for more insight. Google Translate: We can add the Google Translate plugin with desired languages to any of the online forms in Finalsite Enrollment. We do caution against its use, however, as Google has sunset its support for the free Google Translate for Websites widget, resulting in concerns about long-term functionality. Additional Note: If your school provides pre-translated forms, we can build the forms using the translations you provide. International Forms: Identify international-specific forms that need to be created within Finalsite Enrollment or linked to checklist items from other sites for families to fill out and complete. Some examples include the I-20 form, health forms, transcripts, relocation forms, additional recommendations, etc. Custom international fields: Think about specific questions you need to ask on forms, and internal-facing fields you manage within the record to collect international data for reporting. Use yes/no or single select fields as much as possible for optimal reporting, as open text fields don't allow you to group your data for accuracy or silo data on a specific field value. To provide flexibility in a response, you can include an 'other' option that populates a text field to support answers outside of your drop-down list. Some examples of custom fields include language program, citizenship country, number of language-specific years of study, language-specific proficiency levels, language test scores, etc. Checklist Items International Forms: Tie international forms as explained above to checklist items. Some examples include the I-20 form, health forms, transcripts, relocation forms, additional recommendations, etc. International Testing: Create checklist items for all international testing requirements such as TOEFL test results or other language test scores if applicable, placement tests, proficiency tests, language testing, etc. Consultants Create consultants within your site that are working with international families via the quick action menu (+). Click here to learn how. If a consultant did not fill out the application form, you can tie them to their respective contacts in your site and email them an authentication code so they can manage their consultee's checklist to ensure all requirements are turned in on time and understood. Click here to learn how. Communications can be sent directly to consultants via the recipient options when sending communications individually and in bulk. Communications Include international contact information in email signatures as needed. Automate communications with the 'is international' field set to 'yes' to invite families to international events, provide information about international student organizations and/or special services. This will develop a sense of community, school spirit and a feeling of belonging. Include any international specific deadlines in communications or in the 'contact communication area' of the Parent Portal that can be shown/hidden based on business rules for an international field. Parent Portal Customization Include any international specific admission/enrollment contacts information if applicable. Click here to update. Include international specific information or translation in your form thank you pages, and/or contact communication area as appropriate. Click here to update. Financial Support Set up any international-specific tuition amounts, discounts, fees grants, and/or scholarships. Include options to support international pay. Note about custom payment options You can set up a custom payment option (such as Flywire) in order to allow international families to pay. Please note that you may only set up one custom payment option. IMPORTANT: This custom payment method will be visible to all students, not just international ones, and cannot be restricted by business rules. International Custom Payment Example If you choose Flywire as the custom payment method, a link to it can be provided on the fee page for parents or guardians who select this option. Reporting Customize filter options in list pages with international specific fields as needed for daily reporting. Create saved searches on international data.",

    "body": "Overview With the enrollment module in Finalsite Enrollment, you can generate electronic enrollment contracts so that a student's parent(s) can complete and sign the document from their Parent Portal. Contracts have a unique workflow comprised of different states , beginning when new students are moved into enrollment (or when returning students are rolled over to the new school year) and ending when the contract is signed, submitted, and the deposit is paid. Read on to learn more about how to generate contracts, as well as how and when to regenerate them. Click to jump to: Preparing for Contract Generation Generating Contracts in Bulk Generating Individual Contracts Regenerating Contracts How-To: Prepare for Contract Generation Before generating contracts, it's critical to do the following in your Finalsite Enrollment site: Review and update (if needed) all tuition and fee amounts . Review all contract fee rules and confirm that tuition and fee amounts are populating as expected for the correct students. If you need to add, edit, or remove any contract fee rules, please contact Support . Review the list of term-based fields , so that you know which fields clear out automatically on a year-over-year basis. Clear out any non-term-based fields that drive tuition and fees in bulk, such as custom scholarship and financial aid fields. Click here to learn how. Identify if you need any required contract fields that are set at the time of contract generation, such as deposit or contract due dates. Confirm that you have enrollment enabled in the Parent Portal when you are ready for the enrollment checklist and contract (once generated) to be accessible by families. You can leave parent enrollment disabled while you preview and update contracts, which means families will not see the enrollment checklist or contract in the Parent Portal. Even if you generate contracts for students, as long as parent enrollment is disabled parents will not be able to view anything in the Parent Portal. Contracts start in a status of ' Pending ,' which allows you to preview all tuition and fee amounts before they're available in the parent portal. Click here to learn more about previewing contracts. Once contracts have been previewed to test tuition and fee amounts and rules, you can generate them individually or in bulk so that they're available in the Parent Portal - read on below for specific instructions. Once contracts are generated, a good practice is to send an enrollment email with instructions for logging into the Parent Portal, authenticating to the student, and any additional steps needed for your enrollment process. How-To: Generate Contracts in Bulk In most cases, it is best to generate contracts in bulk for both new and returning students, to reduce the amount of manual work for you and your team. However, you can always generate contracts individually within the student's contact record as well - see the How-To section below on individual contract generation. Preparing &amp; Filtering Contact List for Contract Generation To generate contracts in bulk, click into the Enrollment Tab in your Finalsite Enrollment site. On this page, you will see a column for Contract Status, which specifies the state the contract is currently in for that student. When generating contracts in bulk, you only want to generate ' Pending ' contracts, as these are the ones that are not yet generated. If you have a mix of contract states such as ' In Progress ' or ' Pending Payment ,' you can use the blue Filter Options button on the page and filter down to ONLY 'Pending ' status contracts to avoid regenerating contracts that have already been started. You may also set the enrollment type, status, or other filters as needed. For example, some schools choose to generate contracts in different batches based on a set list of criteria such as grade level, domestic vs. international, and so on. Please note: When using the bulk contract generation action, contracts that are in the status of generated or in progress will be overwritten; however, contracts that have been fully submitted will not be regenerated. This information will be specified in the Contract Generation modal window. Selecting Bulk Action &amp; Generating Contracts Once you have the correct list of students displaying, you are ready to begin generating their contracts using the bulk action. Check the box next to the Name column to select all contacts on the page, then click on the green Edit button in the upper right - select the Generate Contracts option. If you have more than one page of students, you will need to repeat this process on each page. You can change the number of contacts that appear per page on the Basic Setup page . The Contract Generation window will display with some important bullet points to review prior to contract generation. If any students you selected have a contract with the status of ' Generated ' or 'In Progress ,' they will be listed in this window, with a warning that their contracts will be regenerated and the existing contract will be overwritten . If any students you selected have a contract with the status of ' Submitted ,' they will be listed in this window, with a note that their contracts will not be regenerated . Please note that If you need to regenerate any submitted contracts at any point, you can regenerate them on an individual basis within the Manage Contract menu on the student's contact record (this will delete the existing submitted contract for the student). Click here to learn about contract states and regeneration rules, as only certain contract states require regeneration when fees or fee rules are changed. Once you have completed the action items and reviewed the list of students with submitted or in-progress contracts (if applicable), you can click the green Next button at the bottom of the window to proceed to the Confirm Contract Generation section. If you have any required contract fields set, you will be prompted to fill them in on this page. Then, you will type the word ' GENERATE' into the box provided and click the green Submit button to complete the bulk contract generation action. As explained, the process will take a few minutes to complete. All 'Pending' status contracts will then update to a status of 'Generated' and will be available within the Parent Portal, as long as parent enrollment is enabled . Once contracts are generated in bulk, you can send an enrollment email to all of your enrolling families letting them know their contract is ready and how to access it in the Parent Portal. Click here to learn how to send emails in Finalsite Enrollment. Make sure to generate contracts for all pages of contacts by repeating these steps. How-To: Generate Individual Contracts Although bulk generation is recommended in most cases, there may be times when you need to generate (or regenerate) a contract for an individual student. This can be done from the student's contact record using the Manage Contract menu towards the upper right. The Manage Contract menu appears once a contact enters an enrollment status. In addition to generating the contract, this is also where you can preview the contract in full (at any time) or preview the tuition and fees (after contract generation only) for any student. After clicking the 'Generate Contract' option in this menu, you will be taken through the same process and set of steps as when generating contracts in bulk: reviewing the information provided, setting any required contract fields, then typing in the word 'GENERATE' to confirm the contract generation action. After you generate the contract, you have more options available within the Manage Contract Menu, as shown below: Preview Contract : Allows you to preview the full contract as it would appear for the family in the Parent Portal. This is a great way to preview aspects of the student's contract, such as the language, tuition and fee amounts, payment plans available, and whether the dual signature will be required for the student or not. Preview Tuition &amp; Fees: This action is only available after the contract has been generated. It will display a window with a summary of all tuition and fees included on the contract, as well as any available optional fees and payment plans. Regenerate Contract: Allows you to regenerate the contract for the student. If the student has an existing submitted or in-progress contract for the current enrollment year, this action will delete it. Certain contract states require regeneration for changes to be applied - read the section below on Contract Regeneration to learn more. How-To: Regenerate Contracts If you need to make changes to a contract, only certain contract states require regeneration for changes to apply. When a contract is regenerated, the parent will need to start over from the beginning; however, any field data that was previously submitted will still pre-populate on the form, unless it is manually cleared out. Pending, Generated, and In Progress contract states DO NOT require regeneration if you need to: Update a fee or fee rule Add or remove a fee or fee rule Add a value to a custom field or to a required contract field When these changes are made on your Finalsite Enrollment site, the contract form will update automatically once the parent goes back into the contract or once you view it as an admin. A general message will display at the top of the contract to notify the parent that changes have been made on the form and to review before proceeding. Pending Signature (dual signature schools only), Pending Payment (of deposit), and Submitted contract states DO require generation if you need to: Update a fee or fee rule Add or remove a fee or fee rule Add a value to a custom field or to a required contract field Parents are not automatically notified if their student's contact is regenerated. You will need to contact them and let them know to return to the Parent Portal and complete the contract again. Please note: If a contract was generated for the wrong term, then regeneration is required regardless of the contract state. -- You have two options for contract regeneration: Regenerate the contract with the parent's signature Regenerate and submit the contract internally Read below to learn how to regenerate the contract with the parent's signature or click here to learn how to regenerate the contract internally. Generated and In Progress state contracts can be regenerated from the enrollment list pages (using the 'Generate Contracts' bulk action described above) OR from a student's contact record. However, submitted contracts can ONLY be regenerated from a student's contact record, not from a list page. From the student's contact record, click into the Manage Contract menu towards the upper right, then choose the Regenerate Contract option. The Contract Regeneration window will appear. This looks very similar to the contract generation window, with the addition of some information on what happens to payment plans when a contract is regenerated. Click the green Next button at the bottom of the window to proceed to the Confirm Contract Regeneration section. Here, you will type the word 'REGENERATE' into the box provided, then click the green Submit button to finish regenerating the contract. The contract status will become ' Generated ' again, and both your team and the parent can view and access the updated contract. Please note: Regenerating a contract will delete the existing submitted or in-progress contract for the student, if one exists for that enrollment year. As specified in the Contract Regeneration window, deleted contracts cannot be recovered.

    "body": "Overview You can run events without having to bring families to campus by integrating a video conferencing software into your existing Finalsite Enrollment workflow. Most video conferencing programs offer various plans and pricing based on what you need. A couple of options are: Zoom Google Hangouts Meet How-To 1 - Create Event in Zoom/Google Meet/Etc. Inside your video conferencing software, create a new scheduled meeting or use your regular link and copy the link provided. This will be used later in Finalsite Enrollment. 2 - Create Calendar in Finalsite Enrollment In Finalsite Enrollment, navigate to Scheduling &gt; Calendars. Click on Add a new Calendar to create a new calendar for your virtual event. You can also click on an existing calendar to edit it. After creating the calendar, make sure you have at least one date and time available for families to select. Learn more about creating appointment slots here . 3 - Add Event Link to the Calendar Schedule Once you've created your calendar, you'll need to add a new Schedule. You can also edit existing schedules that you've already created for a calendar. When creating or editing an existing schedule, you will have the option to add a video conferencing link and/or custom appointment text associated with that schedule. This is helpful if you have multiple people that will be conducting virtual interviews or meetings, and each needs to use their own video conferencing link. Click here for more information on schedules. Note: a best practice is to use an ongoing meeting link rather than a one-time link to ensure it will work for all attendees in the future. 4 - Update Calendar Emails Next, click into 'Calendar Settings' - 'Edit settings'. From here, you can update the Confirmation Email Template with relevant details. Our recommended best practice is to let families know that they will receive a video conferencing link X days in advance of their appointment in a reminder email. This is to help prevent meeting interruptions or accidental logins by families prior to their assigned time slot. When updating the Reminder Email Template, you can use the merge token for the video conferencing link #{{appointment.video_conferencing_link}} or custom appointment text #{{appointment.custom_schedule_text}} and add further instructions about the virtual event. This ensures that the family will have the details they need to join it later. You can customize the text of the email template to your liking. Below is an example of a confirmation email template for a virtual event. As a best practice, include this same information in the Appointment Reminder Email Template. Families are able to see the Video Conferencing Link and Custom Text, if used, by clicking the View Appointment button next to the associated calendar checklist item in the Parent Portal. 5 - Update Checklists/Forms To allow students to sign up via the student checklist, make sure you have the 'Allow parents to book appointments via the checklist in the Parent Portal' option checked from your calendar settings. Then, navigate to 'Settings' - 'Checklists' and create a new checklist item for your virtual event. Click here for more information. If you want families to sign up for the event on the Inquiry Form, you can set this up the same way you would any other calendar event, by using an 'Appointment' type field on the form.

How-To: Use TILA related merge tokens #{{contract.tila_payment_summary}} \u2013 this token displays the payment plan fee, finance charge, amount financed, and total sale price information. The elements in red are automatically generated based on the tuition and fees selected on a previous page. The other text cannot be customized as it follows the FTC guidelines on required language. #{{contract.payment_schedule}} \u2013 this token displays the payment schedule as selected by the parent on a prior page of the contract. Both of the above tokens can be used in letters, emails, or forms other than the contract. For example, the payment schedule token could be used to include information in the contract thank you email or a follow-up letter sent to the parents after contract signing. Here is an example of how these tokens can be used to create a TILA statement: As you see, the disclosure form works in conjunction with itemized tuition, fees, deposit, and payment selections used on a prior page of the contract to provide a clear overview of the payment schedule and related elements necessary to satisfy TILA disclosure. How-To: Understand TILA APR Calculation Calculating APR is very straightforward for payment plans as they are less than a year and, typically, do not have compounding interest. A common plan looks like this: 10-month plan (9-month payment term) A payment plan fee (percentage of total balance or net tuition, or alternatively a flat fee). A mandatory Tuition Refund Plan (generally a flat fee). The APR calculation is: charges \u00f7 amount financed \u00d7 12 \u00f7 term (the length of time between the first payment and last payment) Finance charges (required payment plan fees) divided by Amount financed (balance due after deposit) multiplied by 12 (one year) divided by length of term A note on how to understand \"term\" in TILA calculations: 'Term' is defined as the length of time between the first payment and last payment. For Example: If a payment plan had two payments due July 1st and January 1st, the term would be 6 . The term for this plan is 6 because there are 6 months between the first payment and the last payment. Additional Information Any fee that is required to select the payment plan is generally considered a finance charge. If you are charging a monthly percentage fee on the balance of the tuition, the Finalsite Enrollment TILA statement will not currently reflect the proper amount. Please let us know if this is your method of calculation and we will look at adding an alternate calculation method to the product. Engage your legal team Always talk with your legal team before updating your contract and processes. State and Federal laws vary so what works for your school may not work for another. Please note that Finalsite Enrollment cannot provide suggestions/guidance on legal matters for your school.

    "body": "Overview of Parent Enrollment Cycle Parent/Guardian receives an enrollment email from your school with instructions on how to log into the Parent Portal and authenticate to access the Contract/Registration Form. Note : If you used Finalsite Enrollment for your enrollment process in the last year, returning families that are already authenticated will not need to re-authenticate. Parent/Guardian completes the Contract/Registration Form and signs it. If you have dual signatures , two parents/guardians will need to sign. Parent/Guardian will then pay the Deposit/Registration Fee . If you\u2019re using dual signatures , either parent can pay the deposit once both signatures have been submitted. After the deposit is submitted, the contract moves into a Submitted status and the parent/guardian cannot change anything unless you regenerate the Contract. If your school is using the FACTS Integration , the parent/guardian can follow the link on the FACTS checklist item to complete the process. Parent/Guardian will then complete any remaining enrollment checklist items . Once all required items are complete, the student is automatically moved from the 'Enrollment in Progress' status to the 'Enrolled' status.

    "body": "Overview For schools using the Admissions module in Finalsite Enrollment, an Application Fee can be collected from families upon submission of their student's Application Form. You can also use custom fee rules to waive fees or set differing amounts for certain students. Did you know? For Schools that use our Billing Module: Did you know that Application and AdHoc Form Fees now appear on the ledger? Read more about this within our Billing: Understanding AdHoc and Application Form Fees article! In this article How-To: Manage the Application Fee Application Fee Paid Email Receipt Tracking Application Fees Application Fee Waiver Code Best Practices How-To: Manage the Application Fee To configure the Application Fee settings, navigate to Settings - Financial - Application Fee in your Finalsite Enrollment site. Within the Application Fee Setup page, you have access to the following options: Collect Application Fee: Check this box to activate the collection of the application fee on your application form. Default Fee Amount: The default amount to be paid as an application fee. Payment Methods: Check the boxes of the payment methods you want available to parents paying the application fee. Please note: You must have a payment processor set up and integrated with Finalsite Enrollment to accept Credit Card or Electronic Check payments. Application Fee Rules: Any Application Fee Rules will be listed here. Application Fee Rules can be used to assess different application fee amounts for students based on the application form's field selections. For example, if you want to charge a different fee for international students or waive the fee for children of faculty, you can do this with fee rules. Contact Finalsite Enrollment Support to add or change fee rules. Remember to click the Save button after making any changes on the page! Application Fee Paid Email Receipt Parents or guardians who pay the application fee electronically will receive an automated application receipt email. This template is system generated, and not customizable or viewable within your communication templates. Below is a preview of the template with an important internal note for clarification. Tracking Application Fees Your Application fees can be tracked within a parent's ledger as well as within the following reports, segmented below based on whether or not our Billing Module is being used: All Schools For all schools (even if you are not using our Billing Module), you can track Application fees via the Payment History report. Billing Schools If you are using our Billing Module, in addition to the Payment History report, you can also track Application fees within the Ledger Report . The record of the payment is also displayed within a Parent/Payer's ledger within their contact record. Click here to learn more about managing Application fees within a checklist and ledger. Application Fee Waiver Code Best Practices If your school uses application fee waiver codes, it is important to understand the benefits as well as some potential drawbacks. Please note: Waiver codes are case-sensitive . Remember to communicate this to the parents/families whom you are giving the code to. If the code that is entered on the form does not exactly match the waiver you have set, it will not work. Benefits You can reduce or completely waive an application fee for certain families based on any criteria you define (e.g. families that requested financial aid). You can use a waiver code as an incentive for attending an event. Drawbacks: There is one waiver code for everyone. This can present challenges, as one parent could share the code with another parent without the school's consent There are no expiration dates for waiver codes. Parents will be prompted for the code on the Application Form, not on the payment page Solutions: If a waiver code is not used, Admins can \"force submit\" an application form that is in the 'Pending Payment' stage as a way of letting a parent bypass payment of the application fee. To do this, follow these steps: Make sure that the parent saves the Application Form when they are on the payment page , not any prior pages. This puts the form in 'Pending Payment', which are the only forms that can be force submitted by admins. Go to the Forms Inbox - Draft Applications and locate the student in the list. Click on the Submit Form button in the rightmost column and the system will ask you to confirm your choice: \"Please confirm that you wish to submit this application and bypass the online payment process. Once submitted, this action cannot be undone.\" Once you confirm, the Application Form will be submitted for the student. If you do not see the Submit Form button for a student, it is because the form is still in a Draft status instead of Pending Payment. Revisit Step 1 above with the parent. If you need to record that the fee was waived and a reason for the waiver, you can request the addition of an internal field from Finalsite Enrollment Support . The field will live in the applicant record, and you can provide a set list of values to track different waiver code reasons or a yes/no field, both of which can be searched on within the Search &amp; Reports page.

    "body": "Overview The Document Request Form feature of Finalsite Enrollment can be used to create an Online Transcript &amp; School Records request process for your school during the Admissions or Enrollment Process. This article will detail the process, as well as some best practices and examples for you to use. How-To: Understand the Request Process Flow Document Request Forms function very similarly to online teacher recommendation forms in Finalsite Enrollment. Here are the basic steps in the process: Parent submits request to current school via Parent Portal. Recipient at current or former school receives the request email. Recipient clicks on link in the email and is taken to the request form where they can securely upload files. Please note: All files are uploaded and transferred via TLS1.2 256-bit encryption . Parent receives a notification once the files have been submitted, and the associated checklist item is marked as complete. File upload includes support for uploading multiple files at a time. The uploaded files are not visible to students or parents - they remain confidential to the school. The document request form can also collect additional data beyond file uploads, such as form fields or signatures. This means that you can ask additional questions to the person completing the request. How-To: Best Practices Provide clear information on the checklist explanation for parents, including any release disclaimers. Provide clear instructions to the current school, including what documents to upload and alternative methods to submit the documents if needed. Include terms of service and waivers in your application form that cover the collection of transcripts, school records, recommendations, and other student data. If you have a process to confirm and review submitted transcripts and school records to ensure the proper documents have been received, you can use automated communication plans to create reminders and/or saved searches to provide visibility into recently submitted documents. Always perform an end-to-end test to verify the process and to review the messaging at each step in the process. Handling Records from Multiple Schools Depending on your process and the student's education history, you may require records from multiple schools. In most cases, this scenario can be identified as part of the initial application form based on questions asked there. Those answers can be used to display the appropriate checklist for that student via checklist business rules. If you have any questions or need help setting up your online process, please contact Support . Example Email for Online Records Requests Providing clear and easy to understand instructions in the Document Request Email will facilitate getting documents back faster and more consistently. Here is an example email that can be customized to suit your school's needs. Dear Registrar, Principal, Dean, or Secretary, Under the provisions of United States FERPA public law 93-380, you are receiving this request and the parent/guardians of {{contact.first_name}} {{contact.last_name}} hereby give permission for you (the school) to release the information requested below. Requested information will be kept confidential. RECORDS REQUEST Requesting School: {school.long_name} Student Name: {{contact.first_name}} {{contact.last_name}} Birthdate: {contact.birth_date} Parent Names: {{contact.salutation_first_and_last_names}} Parent Contact Phone: {{contact.parent1.phone_1}} Please submit the following school records: First report card from the current academic year.

    "body": "Overview This article is designed to give you an overview of the process that parents/guardians will go through in the Parent Portal to enroll their students in your school. Please note that before a parent can complete this process, you must generate the contract for their student(s) and enable enrollment in the Parent Portal . You should also make sure that your Enrollment Checklist is ready with all of the items you need the family to complete. How-To: Parent Portal Login / Account Creation After you\u2019ve sent your enrollment emails to both new and returning families, parents will be instructed to log into their Parent Portal to access the Contract and Enrollment Checklist for their student(s). They can Sign In to an existing Parent Portal Account by entering their Email Address and Password. If they forgot their password, they can click on the 'Forgot your password?' link (see below for more information) Once they fill out both fields (email and password), they\u2019ll click the blue Sign In button. If they do not have an existing Parent Portal Account, they will need to create a new one by clicking on the blue Create an Account button. The text you see above the sign-in area is called the Login Page Description and is customizable on your Parent Portal Content page. *If the parent/guardian forgets their password, they\u2019ll be asked for the email address they used to sign up previously. If a Parent Portal Account with that email address is found in the system, an email will be sent to the parent/guardian with instructions on how to reset their password. You can also send password reset emails from the admin portal - click here to learn how. How-To: Access the Enrollment Checklist After the parent/guardian successfully logs into the Parent Portal, they\u2019ll see any linked student(s) listed in the Students section of the page. To access the checklist for any of the enrolling students, they\u2019ll click on the blue Continue Enrollment Process button or the View Checklist link to the right. The checklist progress bar on this page will fill in with green as items are completed on the checklist, which is the same way it displays on the admin side within the Enrollment List Page. The parent/guardian can also see how many items are left to complete as they work through the checklist. A best practice is to have your Contract and Deposit checklist items at the top of the list so that they are the first items seen by the parent/guardian when they open their student's enrollment checklist. You can rearrange the order of your checklist items on the checklist setup page . On the Enrollment Checklist, all required items will be listed at the top, in the same order as they are arranged on the fields setup page. Any optional items will be below the required items, in their section titled 'Optional Steps'. How-To: Complete the Enrollment Contract To start filling out the enrollment contract, the parent/guardian can click on the blue Complete Form button next to that item on the enrollment checklist. Please note: If a parent/guardian is reporting that they see the Contract checklist item, but not the option to complete the form, check the following: Make sure that the contract is generated , without errors. An easy way to check this is to go to the Enrollment List Page (by clicking the Enrollment tab) in the admin portal. Find the student on the list and make sure that the Contract Status column lists the contract as Generated and does not have a warning symbol next to it. Make sure that a parent/guardian ( not the student) is authenticated and has financial responsibility switched on. Financial responsibility is required to view the contract, and since students cannot have financial responsibility, the contract is hidden if they are the only ones authenticated. To review this, go to the student's contact record in your admin portal, then click on the Parent Portal Access page . Your Contract is customizable and so the specifics of it will be unique to your school; however, these forms typically consist of contractual text, a breakdown of tuition/fees/aid, and payment plan options. You may also choose to include a contact update page, where parents/guardians can update any contact information (e.g. phone numbers, emails) as needed. Any field data that was previously captured for the student or parents/guardians will pre-populate on the Contract. The parent/guardian can edit these fields as needed within the form and they\u2019ll update accordingly in your admin portal once the form is submitted.c Parents can select ' Save and Finish Later ' at the bottom of the page at any point before submitting payments. If the parent opens the contract, it will change from a status of Generated to a status of In Progress . However, if the parent completes all pages of the Contract up to the point of the Deposit page, the contract will go into a status of Pending Payment . Click here for more information on contract states. How-To: Pay the Deposit The final page of your contract is most likely the Deposit page. The parent will select their method of payment, fill out any necessary fields, and click the corresponding payment button to submit the contract and deposit. At this point, the Contract moves into a status of Submitted and the parent can no longer go back into the Contract to make changes. The Deposit checklist item will be immediately marked off as complete once the parent/guardian submits their payment information if they pay by credit card or electronic check . If the parent/guardian elected to pay the deposit by paper check or a custom payment method , the Deposit checklist item will need to be manually marked as complete by your team (in the admin portal) when you receive the payment. A recommended search within your Enrollment List Page \u2013 Filter Options is to look for a Complete Checklist Item of Contract and an Incomplete Checklist Item of Deposit. This way you can send a bulk communication to families that need to submit their deposit by a certain deadline.

They look at the field data on student records to determine whether or not the fee applies to them. For example, if you have a Mystery Club fee that only applies to high school students who are in the Mystery Club, we can add a rule to the Mystery Club Fee to tell it to check if the student is in High School and in the Mystery Club before it applied the fee to their contract. Important: For fee rules to be set up and to work properly, you must have the values for any related fields set. Like Contract Fees, Contract Fee rules need to be added and edited by our team . If you need one or more added or updated, please connect with us . In this article Accessing Contract Fee Rules Contract Fee Rule Details Edit History Accessing contract fee rules Contract Fee Rules are attached to the contact fee page. If there is a fee rule attached to one of your contract fees, you can expand the fee to see the details of the rule or rules attached. Contract Fee Rules Details Expand this dropdown to read about each header in the above screenshot. Rule Description: This is the name of the rule. It's internal only which means it never shows up on the parent end. Rule: This is the rule that our team writes to tell the fee how the contract fee should apply. Active: If this is checked, the rule is enabled. Last Edit: The last date that an edit has been made to the fee. Edit History: Click this to open a pop-up box showing the edits that have been made, the date they were made on, and the name of the individual who made the change. The box will show the last 5 edits to the rule. Edit History To view the edit history of a contract fee rule, click on the View Changes link in the Edit History column. This will open a pop-up box that displays the log of edits that have been made to the fee or rule. You'll see the name of the person who made the changes, the date the changes were made, and the details of the change. Our team must add and edit Contract Fee Rules for you.

    "body": "Overview Parents and students can send document requests from the Parent Portal in the same manner as online teacher recommendations . This is a great way to allow families to request online transcripts and/or school records from a student's current (previous) school, and have those documents flow directly into Finalsite Enrollment. The submitted document request form and any attached documents remain confidential to your school. Click here to go to the Document Request Overview . How-To: Send Document Requests from the Parent Portal To allow families to send document requests from the Parent Portal, you must first have a document request form set up and linked to a checklist item. Click here for more information. When a parent logs in to the Portal and clicks into the checklist for one of their students, they will see any document request forms listed with a blue Send Request button next to them. The parent explanation for the checklist item will also display directly below it if you want to provide further instructions to families here. Clicking the Send Request button will show a window where the parent can type in the name and email of the person they want to complete the request. This window will also list the name and apply grade of the student for whom the request is being sent. After clicking the blue Send button, a confirmation message will appear at the top of the page indicating that the request has been successfully sent and that an email will be sent to the parent once the document request is completed. Please note: This email will be sent to the email address associated with the Parent Portal Account that the parent is logged into when they send the request. As soon as the recipient submits the document request form, the associated checklist item will be marked as complete (with date of submission) on the parent and admin side checklist. How-To: Edit, Resend, or View Details for Document Requests Once the initial document request has been sent, the family has the option to edit the request (to send it to a different recipient) or resend the request (to send a reminder email to the existing recipient). They will also have the option to view the details of the current request and any past request history. Read on below for more on each of these options. Edit Request The blue Edit Request button can be used to send a request to a different recipient or update the receiving email address. Please note: Sending a new request will automatically cancel the previously existing request for that document request form. If you want families to request multiple documents from different recipients or schools, you will need to set up separate online forms and checklist items for each. When a family chooses to edit the request, they will be informed that by sending a new request, the existing request will be canceled. If a previous recipient clicks on the link to complete a document request that has since been canceled, they will be notified that the request has been withdrawn. Resend Request The green Resend button can be used to send a follow-up email to the recipient that the most recent request was sent to, reminding them to complete the document request for the student. In the details window that appears, the parent/student will click the green Send Reminder Email button to confirm the resend email action. They can also view the most recent request, along with a history of any past requests that were made, within this window. View Request Details The View Details link can be used to see the details (i.e. status, recipient name and email, and date sent) of the most recent request, as well as a history of any past requests. Status will be one of the following: Sent: Email request has been sent, but the recipient has not yet started filling out the document request form. In Progress: Recipient has started filling out the document request form but has not yet submitted it. Completed: Recipient has submitted the document request form. The checklist item will also be checked off in this case. Canceled: Request was withdrawn due to a new request being sent. When the document request is completed, an email notification will be sent to the email address associated with the Parent Portal Account that the parent is logged into when they send the request. The recipient will also receive an email with a copy of the completed form or uploaded document(s) in a printable PDF.

    "body": "Overview Admins/Users can send new document requests or track the status of any existing ones within a student's checklist on their contact record . This works the same way as an online teacher recommendation form . Please note: Admin-submitted document request forms will come from the email address that they are using to log into the Finalsite Enrollment system. Read on below to learn more about tracking and managing document request forms for a student. Click here to go to the Document Request Overview . How-To: Admin Checklist View and Management To view and manage document request forms as an admin, visit a student's contact record and locate the checklist items on the summary tab . Manage Document Request Forms If a request has already been sent for document request form checklist items, the date it was sent will appear underneath the name of the checklist item. Any incomplete document request form checklist items will have a 'Manage' button next to them (to the right below the checklist item name). Clicking this button will allow you to view the details (i.e. status, teacher name and email, and date sent) of the most recent request sent, as well as any past requests sent. Status will be one of the following: Sent: Email request has been sent, but the recipient has not yet started filling out the document request form. In Progress: Recipient has started filling out the document request form but has not yet submitted it. Completed: Recipient has submitted the document request form. The checklist item will also be checked off in this case. Canceled: Request was withdrawn due to a new request being sent. See section on editing a document request below for details. From the details window, you can also send a reminder email to the recipient for the most recent request, or edit the request to send to a new recipient or update the receiving email address. Upload to Document Request Checklist Items If you want to upload directly to a document request form checklist item, instead of using the request workflow, you can do this by clicking the 'Upload' button next to the checklist item (this will only appear for incomplete document request checklist items). This will attach the form to the student record, and mark the checklist item as complete. When files are uploaded internally to a Document Request Form type checklist item, parents will be able to see that the checklist item has been checked off, but they will not see the contents of the uploaded file -- this remains confidential with the school. View Completed Document Request Forms When a document request form is completed by the recipient, the checklist item will automatically be marked as complete with the date the file was submitted. You will also now have the option to view the form and the associated uploaded files by clicking on ' View Form '. Any uploaded files will appear with a hyperlink to view the upload. Important Notes Checklist items, like Document Requests, can have granular-level permissions applied to them, which means that admins without the permission level, will not be able to view/download the item. To learn more about granular permissions, check our Granular Permissions for Emails and Checklists article. Information from document request forms does not write through to the student's contact record. It can be viewed on the submitted form/PDF, or answers can be exported in bulk using a form export. If you would like to set up a form export for one of your document request forms, please contact Support . Completed Document Request Form Confidentiality The submitted document request form and any files uploaded to it remain school confidential. The parent/guardian will NOT have access to view these items. The account who sent the request will receive an email notifying them that the form was completed and the checklist item will also be marked as complete in the Parent Portal.

    "body": "Overview Schools using payment processors integrated with Finalsite Enrollment can collect additional fees from families on AdHoc forms. For example, you might want to have parents complete an annual field trip permission form each year during the enrollment process and have them pay an associated field trip fee upon submission of the form. This is possible to do in Finalsite Enrollment with some configuration work. Additional notes Custom fees are separate from the contract fees used in the Enrollment module. Click here to learn more about contract fees. For schools using our Billing module : please note that, within reports, all custom form fees will show up as 'AdHoc' rather than listing their specific billing category. Good to know: while the reports only list 'AdHoc', you will see the specific billing category listed on the parent's ledger. How-To: View &amp; Set Up Custom Fees Admins with financial permissions can view adhoc fees from 'Settings' - 'Financial' - 'Custom Form Fees' within your Finalsite Enrollment site. Within this page, you can take the following actions: Add new or edit existing fee groups, which are used to contain related sets of fees. For example, you might have a fee group called Activity Fees. Add new or edit existing fee types , which are used to contain individual fee rules, to any existing groups. For example, you might have separate fee types for 'Football', 'Soccer', etc. within your Activity Fees fee group. The fee type name is what appears to parents when making the payment. Edit the name, description, or amount of any existing individual fees. Manage the active/inactive status of any existing individual fees. Delete any existing fee groups , fee types , or individual fees . Manage the accepted payment methods for any of your fee groups. Please note you must already have your payment gateway set up for the selected options The following actions must be handled by our Support team : Adding new individual fees within your fee types. Editing the fee rules (i.e. Conditions) for any existing individual fees. Conditions determine who receives a fee; for example, if a certain group of students will have the fee waived or if there are differing amounts based on grade If you need to reach out to the Support Team for any of the above actions, be sure to include details about the fee you want added or edited so that they can best assist you. How-To: Set Up Associated Checklist Items Once your custom fees have been created and configured, you can set up the needed checklist items to make them live for parents. Custom Fees must be tied to a form in order for parents to be able to pay through Finalsite Enrollment. First, create a checklist item for the Online Form if you do not already have one. Next, create a second checklist item with an Item Type of 'Custom Fee', then select the Fee Grouping and Associated Form from the drop-down menus under the Type heading. Note that you select a Fee Grouping instead of a specific fee. This is because the system will automatically apply the appropriate fee(s) within that fee grouping based on the Conditions or rules that are configured on the Fee Management page. When families log into the Parent Portal and open the associated Online Form, the last page will be the payment page and they must enter their payment information before the form can be submitted.

    "body": "Overview If you have the Enrollment module and are using electronic contracts through the Finalsite Enrollment system, you might choose to use our Countersignature feature on those electronic contracts. This feature allows you to countersign contracts - after all, required parent/guardian entities have signed - by either adding an electronic signature or uploading an image of your signature (or the signature of your Head of School, Principal, etc.). Before you can start countersigning contracts, you must enable and set up the feature. Read on below to learn how to do that! To learn how to countersign contracts as an admin, click here . To learn about the parent experience with countersigned contracts, click here . Click to jump to: Enabling Countersign Feature Uploading a Signature Image Granting Countersign Permissions to Admins/Users Enabling Countersign User Notifications How-To: Enable &amp; Configure Contract Countersign Before you can countersign contracts, there are a few steps to take for setup. Enable Countersign Setting on the Enrollment Setup Page If you haven't enabled the Countersign feature yet, navigate to Settings --&gt; Fields &amp; Data --&gt; Enrollment Setup to do so. Please note: This step must be completed by an Admin or System Admin with Data permissions . Once on the Enrollment Setup page, scroll to the section titled 'Require Countersignature'. Check the box for ' Countersignature Required?' , and then click Save . What happens when the Countersignature feature is enabled: A countersignature field will automatically be added to all active and draft Contract form templates. All student contracts will require a countersignature before they are considered complete (i.e. 'Submitted' status). Disabling the feature will remove the countersignature fields from your contract form templates, and contracts will no longer require a countersignature before being considered complete. This will also remove the Countersign Contracts action on list pages or contact records. Upload a Signature Image After clicking Save , the page will refresh and you will now have the ability to upload a Countersign Image by using the Choose File button. Important Notes Image Type: Only image files, such as JPG and PNG, will work for signature image uploads. PDFs will not work. Image Sizing : We recommend testing image size and quality before uploading to Finalsite Enrollment. Quality/Sizing depends on the type of image and software you use to create it but, in general, an image size of approximately 200-250px wide displays well within contract pdfs. After uploading your file, a preview of the currently active Countersign Image will appear on the page under 'Current Countersign Image'. Please note: Uploading a Countersign Image is optional. You can still countersign contracts using an electronic signature. See below for more information. How-To: Grant Countersign Permissions to Admins/Users Before an admin/user can countersign contracts through the system, they must be granted the Countersign permission. Without this permission, the admin/user will not see the 'Countersign Contracts' action in list pages or contact records, even if the feature is enabled. To grant this permission to one or more admins/users, someone set up as a System Admin in your Finalsite Enrollment site can go to Settings --&gt; Portal --&gt; Admin Portal Accounts . From there, simply check the 'Countersign' box for any accounts you want to have access to the countersign action. For more information on Admin Portal Accounts, click here . How-To: Enable Countersign User Notifications If you want to receive daily email notifications about how many contracts are available to countersign, you can opt into this from the User Notifications page. Notifications are managed on a per-user basis, so if you need someone else to be subscribed to these emails, you will need to instruct them to log into Finalsite Enrollment and complete the steps below. While logged into the admin portal, click on your name in the upper right and then select User Notifications. Once on the page, you'll see the option for 'Contracts needing countersign (Daily Summary)' under the Enrollment grouping. Check the box to opt into the notification. Please note that this is a daily email, separate from the existing activity summary email. The subject line will be 'Contracts Pending Countersignature' and the email will list how many contracts are ready to be countersigned, along with a link to your Students in Enrollment list page. How-To Set Up an Automatic Contract Thank You Email Important Even if enabled within the Communication Setup page, the Contract Thank You Email will not be sent if you are utilizing the Countersign feature. Read further to learn how to manually set up automated communication. If you are using Countersign on your contracts and would like to send an automatic thank you after the contract is complete, you can use an Automated Communication Plan (please note that only Pro accounts have access to set up Automated Communication Plans) Here is how to set this up: First, disable the Contract Thank You system email under the Communication Setup page (Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Communication Setup). Next, craft a personalized thank you email under your Email Templates page, Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates (Custom Emails). Then, set up an Enrollment Automated Communication Plan, using the checklist item trigger for the Contract checklist item being marked as complete and attach the custom email you crafted. Now, once the countersigning process is complete (thus marking the checklist item as complete), your custom automated contract thank you will be sent! For more detailed information on setting up an Automated Communication Plan, please refer to this article . Once the items above are complete, you are ready to start countersigning contracts, which you can do from the Students in Enrollment list page or a contact record. Click here to learn more!

Click to jump to: Countersigning Contracts in Bulk Countersigning Individual Contracts Completed Contracts Display How-To: Countersign Contracts Once the Countersign feature is configured and at least one admin/user has been granted the Countersign permission, you are ready to countersign any student contracts that come in from your enrolling families. Contracts must be in either the Pending Payment or the Pending Countersign state to be countersigned. This means that you can only countersign a contract once all required parents/guardians have signed it. However, it can be countersigned before or after they have paid the deposit. The countersign contracts action can be done in bulk from a list page, or individually from a student's contact record. Read below for instructions on both methods. Countersigning Contracts in Bulk To sign contracts in bulk, navigate to the Enrollment tab - Students in Enrollment list page. From here, you have the option to use the Filter Options to narrow the list down to the contract statuses of 'Pending Countersign' and/or 'Pending Payment', or you can simply select all or some of the students on the page. Once you have at least one student selected, you can click on the green Edit menu - Countersign Contracts.

    "body": "Overview Within Finalsite Enrollment, you have the option to manage various aspects of payments by going to Settings &gt; Financial &gt; Payment Setup . Read on to learn more about what settings you are able to control and the best practices for using them. In this article Credit Card Configuration Electronic Check Configuration Check Configuration Custom Payment Configuration How-To: View the audit log showing changes made to this page Credit Card Configuration Payment Mode This setting determines whether transactions processed through your Finalsite Enrollment site are live or in \"test\" mode. While this is visible for transparency, the setting can only be changed by a member of the Finalsite Enrollment Support team. If you have questions about your setting or believe you need it to be changed, please contact Support . Credit Card Options Display Name: what credit cards are referred to as in the Parent Portal. Submit Button Text: what parents will click to process their payment. Statement Descriptor: Your school's Statement Descriptor is what's used on bank accounts or credit card statements when a payment is made through Payments. The Statement Descriptor is set by default to the Business Website provided during the Payments onboarding/verification process. Example: Finalsite Enrollment.COM . Your descriptor can list up to 19 characters. We recommend adding your school name after the dash. For example, SA-YOUR SCHOOL NAME . Accepted Credit Cards The four options are American Express, Discover, Mastercard, and Visa. In the vast majority of cases, all credit card types should be selected to offer your parents the most flexibility. Credit Card Convenience Fees At the top of the section, you will see the rates that apply to your school. For example, the school in the image above incurs a 3.05% convenience fee charge for credit card payments. Please note Convenience fee rates vary by school. Your school's specific rates are displayed on this page as well as on the Payments page (Setting &gt; Financial &gt; Payments) . On that page, you can see all of your rates displayed in a read-only (uneditable) format. Beneath the convenience fee message on this page, you can choose which charges you want to pass on to parents. For example, if you deselect \"Application\", parents won't be charged a credit card convenience fee for the application fee. However, these fees will still be deducted from your payout. Fee Rate (in percent) and Fee Amount (in dollars) This setting refers to the amount of the credit card convenience fee that you would like to pass along to your parents. Good to know When you update the convenience fees that you are passing along to parents, the Rate Change email is sent out. When you click save after adjusting the rate on either the Credit Card or Electronic Check tabs, you'll see a pop-up window asking you to acknowledge that the email will be sent. Who is the email sent to? This email is automatically sent to affected parents who have autopay enabled. It's sent based on what you update and is only sent to applicable parents with autopay enabled. For example: If you only update the Credit Card convenience fee, only parents with a Credit Card saved to autopay will be emailed. In addition, the email is only sent to active accounts. Active accounts are those that either have: An upcoming charge that will be pulled in the next autopay cycle. Or, an unpaid past charge that will be pulled in the next autopay cycle. This way, parents who are no longer active with the school but may still have autopay enabled on their end will not receive the email. What happens if I click Close instead of Confirm? The rate change that you made will not be saved and the email will not be sent. Where can I update the Rate Change email? It can be updated on the Billing Email templates page: Settings &gt; Communication &gt; Email Templates &gt; Billing Emails Fee Rate (in percent) If you'd like to pass on a percentage-based convenience fee to parents, enter one here. It is possible to set this higher or lower at the discretion of your school if you would like to cover a greater or smaller portion of the merchant fees. It is possible to set this to a negative number if you would like it to be a discount rather than a fee. Fee Amount (in dollars) This is a flat amount that is added to the transaction AFTER the Fee Rate above is calculated. For example: for a charge of $100, if the fee amount is $1.50, and fee rate is 10%, the total convenience fee would be $11.50. IMPORTANT: Convenience fees will be withheld from your payouts even if these are set to 0, as this only refers to the fee that is passed along to your families. Learn more about passing on convenience fees in this article: Payments: Passing on Convenience Fees to Families. Fee Description and Convenience Fee Notification Message Fee Description This is the text that will be displayed wherever the fee is referenced. Convenience Fee Notification Message This checkbox determines whether the parent will see a notification message that they must agree to before processing their payment. Good to know The Fee Description and the amount you pass to parents are also displayed in the Parent portal. If your school is passing on credit card fees to parents, they will see a note like this at the top of their Billing Management tab: Please note: a {fee description displayed here} of {amount you are passing on to parents} will be applied to all Credit Card payments. For example, parents would see this if the text in the Fee Description was \"convenience fee\" and the percentage you are passing to and the Fee Rate (in percent) was set to 3.0%: \"Please note: a convenience fee of 3.0% will be applied to all Credit Card payments.\" It will only display if you are passing along convenience fees to parents. Electronic Check Configuration Electronic Check Options Display Name: what electronic checks are referred to as in the Parent Portal. Submit Button Text: what parents will click to process their payment. Statement Descriptor: Your school's Statement Descriptor is what's used on bank accounts or credit card statements when a payment is made through Payments. The Statement Descriptor is set by default to the Business Website provided during the Payments onboarding/verification process. Example: Finalsite Enrollment.COM . Your descriptor can list up to 19 characters. We recommend adding your school name after the dash. For example, SA-YOUR SCHOOL NAME .

On that page, you can see all of your rates displayed in a read-only (uneditable) format. Below the convenience fee note on this page, you can choose which charges you want to pass on to parents. For example, if you deselect \"Application\", parents won't be charged an electronic check convenience fee for the application fee. However, these fees will still be deducted from your payout.

Fee Description and Convenience Fee Notification Message Fee Description This is the text that will be displayed wherever the fee is referenced.

Good to know The Fee Description and the amount you pass to parents are also displayed in the Parent portal. If your school is passing on electronic check fees to parents, they will see a note like this at the top of their Billing Management tab: Please note: a {fee description displayed here} of {amount you are passing on to parents} will be applied to all Electronic Check payments.

Check Configuration Check Options: This allows you to set the Display Name (what check payments are referred to as in the Parent Portal) and the Submit Button Text (what parents will click to process their payment). Custom Payment Configuration Custom Payment Options: This allows you to set the Display Name (what custom payments are referred to as in the Parent Portal) and the Submit Button Text (what parents will click to process their payment). How-To: View the Audit Log Within the Payment Setup page, you also have access to an audit log that displays the history of any changes made to any of the tabs within this page (Credit card configuration, Electronic Check configuration, Check, and Custom).

    "body": "Overview If you have the Enrollment module and are using electronic contracts through the Finalsite Enrollment system, you might choose to use our Countersignature feature on those electronic contracts. This feature allows you to countersign contracts - after all, required parent/guardian entities have signed - by either adding an electronic signature or uploading an image of your signature (or the signature of your Head of School, Principal, etc.). Parents/Guardians filling out a student contract in the Parent Portal will be able to see that a countersignature is required, and their downloadable PDF copy of the form will include the countersignature (whether an electronic signature or an image was used). Read on below to learn more about the parent experience when using the countersign feature. To learn how to enable and set up the Countersign feature, click here . To learn how to countersign contracts as an admin, click here . Click to jump to: Countersignature Field Pending Countersign Status Completed Contracts Display How-To: Understand the Parent Experience The majority of the experience for parents/guardians filling out the Contract is the same whether countersignatures are enabled or not. However, there are a few key differences of which to be aware. Countersignature Field Enabling the Countersign feature adds a countersignature field to your active Contract Form. This field displays a yellow box that says a countersignature is required on the form. It also lets the parent/guardian know that the contract must be countersigned by a representative from your school before it is considered complete and that a countersigned copy will be available in the Parent Portal after being processed. You will be able to see the countersignature field when previewing the form as well. Please note : The text underneath the Countersign box (see the image above) is not editable and can not be adjusted by our team. Pending Countersign Status If a parent/guardian completes and signs a contract and pays the associated deposit, the contract will go into the Pending Countersign state. This means that it is not considered complete yet. In the Parent Portal, the contract checklist item will display the text 'Pending Countersign' underneath. Important: In the case that the deposit is paid before the contract is countersigned, the deposit checklist item will not show as completed either until the countersignature is added. After the contract is countersigned, the contract is considered submitted, so both the contract and deposit checklist items will be marked as complete.
